		"speech recognition is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies that enable the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers with the main benefit of searchability it is also known as automatic speech recognition asr computer speech recognition or speech to text stt it incorporates knowledge and research in the computer science linguistics and computer engineering fields the reverse process is speech synthesis some speech recognition systems require training also called enrollment where an individual speaker reads text or isolated vocabulary into the system the system analyzes the persons specific voice and uses it to finetune the recognition of that persons speech resulting in increased accuracy systems that do not use training are called speakerindependent systems systems that use training are called speaker dependent speech recognition applications include voice user interfaces such as voice dialing eg call home call routing eg i would like to make a collect call domotic appliance control search key words eg find a podcast where particular words were spoken simple data entry eg entering a credit card number preparation of structured documents eg a radiology report determining speaker characteristics speechtotext processing eg word processors or emails and aircraft usually termed direct voice input the term voice recognition or speaker identification refers to identifying the speaker rather than what they are saying recognizing the speaker can simplify the task of translating speech in systems that have been trained on a specific persons voice or it can be used to authenticate or verify the identity of a speaker as part of a security process from the technology perspective speech recognition has a long history with several waves of major innovations most recently the field has benefited from advances in deep learning and big data the advances are evidenced not only by the surge of academic papers published in the field but more importantly by the worldwide industry adoption of a variety of deep learning methods in designing and deploying speech recognition systems the key areas of growth were vocabulary size speaker independence and processing speed raj reddy was the first person to take on continuous speech recognition as a graduate student at stanford university in the late 1960s previous systems required users to pause after each word reddys system issued spoken commands for playing chess around this time soviet researchers invented the dynamic time warping dtw algorithm and used it to create a recognizer capable of operating on a 200word vocabulary dtw processed speech by dividing it into short frames eg 10ms segments and processing each frame as a single unit although dtw would be superseded by later algorithms the technique carried on achieving speaker independence remained unsolved at this time period during the late 1960s leonard baum developed the mathematics of markov chains at the institute for defense analysis a decade later at cmu raj reddys students james baker and janet m baker began using the hidden markov model hmm for speech recognition james baker had learned about hmms from a summer job at the institute of defense analysis during his undergraduate education the use of hmms allowed researchers to combine different sources of knowledge such as acoustics language and syntax in a unified probabilistic model the 1980s also saw the introduction of the ngram language model much of the progress in the field is owed to the rapidly increasing capabilities of computers at the end of the darpa program in the best computer available to researchers was the pdp10 with mb ram it could take up to minutes to decode just seconds of speech two practical products were by this point the vocabulary of the typical commercial speech recognition system was larger than the average human vocabulary raj reddys former student xuedong huang developed the sphinxii system at cmu the sphinxii system was the first to do speakerindependent large vocabulary continuous speech recognition and it had the best performance in darpas evaluation handling continuous speech with a large vocabulary was a major milestone in the history of speech recognition huang went on to found the speech recognition group at microsoft in raj reddys student kaifu lee joined apple where in he helped develop a speech interface prototype for the apple computer known as casper lernout hauspie a belgiumbased speech recognition company acquired several other companies including kurzweil applied intelligence in and dragon systems in the lh speech technology was used in the windows xp operating system lh was an industry leader until an accounting scandal brought an end to the company in the speech technology from lh was bought by scansoft which became nuance in apple originally licensed software from nuance to provide speech recognition capability to its digital assistant siri in the 2000s darpa sponsored two speech recognition programs effective affordable reusable speechtotext ears in and global autonomous language exploitation gale four teams participated in the ears program ibm a team led by bbn with limsi and univ of pittsburgh cambridge university and a team composed of icsi sri and university of washington ears funded the collection of the switchboard telephone speech corpus containing hours of recorded conversations from over speakers the gale program focused on arabic and mandarin broadcast news speech googles first effort at speech recognition came in after hiring some researchers from nuance the first product was goog411 a telephone based directory service the recordings from goog411 produced valuable data that helped google improve their recognition systems google voice search is now supported in over languages in the united states the national security agency has made use of a type of speech recognition for keyword spotting since at least this technology allows analysts to search through large volumes of recorded conversations and isolate mentions of keywords recordings can be indexed and analysts can run queries over the database to find conversations of interest some government research programs focused on intelligence applications of speech recognition eg darpas earss program and iarpas babel program in the early 2000s speech recognition was still dominated by traditional approaches such as hidden markov models combined with feedforward artificial neural networks today however many aspects of speech recognition have been taken over by a deep learning method called long shortterm memory lstm a recurrent neural network published by sepp hochreiter jurgen schmidhuber in lstm rnns avoid the vanishing gradient problem and can learn very deep learning tasks that require memories of events that happened thousands of discrete time steps ago which is important for speech around lstm trained by connectionist temporal classification ctc started to outperform traditional speech recognition in certain applications in googles speech recognition reportedly experienced a dramatic performance jump of through ctctrained lstm which is now available through google voice to all smartphone users the use of deep feedforward nonrecurrent networks for acoustic modeling was introduced during the later part of by geoffrey hinton and his students at the university of toronto and by li deng and colleagues at microsoft research initially in the collaborative work between microsoft and the university of toronto which was subsequently expanded to include ibm and google hence the shared views of four research groups subtitle in their review paper a microsoft research executive called this innovation the most dramatic change in accuracy since in contrast to the steady incremental improvements of the past few decades the application of deep learning decreased word error rate by this innovation was quickly adopted across the field researchers have begun to use deep learning techniques for language modeling as well in the long history of speech recognition both shallow form and deep form eg recurrent nets of artificial neural networks had been explored for many years during 1980s 1990s and a few years into the 2000s but these methods never won over the nonuniform internalhandcrafting gaussian mixture modelhidden markov model gmmhmm technology based on generative models of speech trained discriminatively a number of key difficulties had been methodologically analyzed in the 1990s including gradient diminishing and weak temporal correlation structure in the neural predictive models all these difficulties were in addition to the lack of big training data and big computing power in these early days most speech recognition researchers who understood such barriers hence subsequently moved away from neural nets to pursue generative modeling approaches until the recent resurgence of deep learning starting around that had overcome all these difficulties hinton et al and deng et al reviewed part of this recent history about how their collaboration with each other and then with colleagues across four groups university of toronto microsoft google and ibm ignited a renaissance of applications of deep feedforward neural networks to speech recognition by early 2010s speech recognition also called voice recognition was clearly differentiated from speaker recognition and speaker independence was considered a major breakthrough until then systems required a training period a ad for a doll had carried the tagline finally the doll that understands you despite the fact that it was described as which children could train to respond to their voice in microsoft researchers reached a historical human parity milestone of transcribing conversational telephony speech on the widely benchmarked switchboard task multiple deep learning models were used to optimize speech recognition accuracy the speech recognition word error rate was reported to be as low as professional human transcribers working together on the same benchmark which was funded by ibm watson speech team on the same task both acoustic modeling and language modeling are important parts of modern statistically based speech recognition algorithms hidden markov models hmms are widely used in many systems language modeling is also used in many other natural language processing applications such as document classification or statistical machine translation modern generalpurpose speech recognition systems are based on hidden markov models these are statistical models that output a sequence of symbols or quantities hmms are used in speech recognition because a speech signal can be viewed as a piecewise stationary signal or a shorttime stationary signal in a short time scale eg milliseconds speech can be approximated as a stationary process speech can be thought of as a markov model for many stochastic purposes another reason why hmms are popular is that they can be trained automatically and are simple and computationally feasible to use in speech recognition the hidden markov model would output a sequence of ndimensional realvalued vectors with n being a small integer such as outputting one of these every milliseconds the vectors would consist of cepstral coefficients which are obtained by taking a fourier transform of a short time window of speech and decorrelating the spectrum using a cosine transform then taking the first most significant coefficients the hidden markov model will tend to have in each state a statistical distribution that is a mixture of diagonal covariance gaussians which will give a likelihood for each observed vector each word or for more general speech recognition systems each phoneme will have a different output distribution a hidden markov model for a sequence of words or phonemes is made by concatenating the individual trained hidden markov models for the separate words and phonemes described above are the core elements of the most common hmmbased approach to speech recognition modern speech recognition systems use various combinations of a number of standard techniques in order to improve results over the basic approach described above a typical largevocabulary system would need context dependency for the phonemes so phonemes with different left and right context have different realizations as hmm states it would use cepstral normalization to normalize for a different speaker and recording conditions for further speaker normalization it might use vocal tract length normalization vtln for malefemale normalization and maximum likelihood linear regression mllr for more general speaker adaptation the features would have socalled delta and deltadelta coefficients to capture speech dynamics and in addition might use heteroscedastic linear discriminant analysis hlda or might skip the delta and deltadelta coefficients and use splicing and an ldabased projection followed perhaps by heteroscedastic linear discriminant analysis or a global semitied co variance transform also known as maximum likelihood linear transform or mllt many systems use socalled discriminative training techniques that dispense with a purely statistical approach to hmm parameter estimation and instead optimize some classificationrelated measure of the training data examples are maximum mutual information mmi minimum classification error mce and minimum phone error mpe decoding of the speech the term for what happens when the system is presented with a new utterance and must compute the most likely source sentence would probably use the viterbi algorithm to find the best path and here there is a choice between dynamically creating a combination hidden markov model which includes both the acoustic and language model information and combining it statically beforehand the finite state transducer or fst approach a possible improvement to decoding is to keep a set of good candidates instead of just keeping the best candidate and to use a better scoring function re scoring to rate these good candidates so that we may pick the best one according to this refined score the set of candidates can be kept either as a list the nbest list approach or as a subset of the models a lattice re scoring is usually done by trying to minimize the bayes risk or an approximation thereof instead of taking the source sentence with maximal probability we try to take the sentence that minimizes the expectancy of a given loss function with regards to all possible transcriptions ie we take the sentence that minimizes the average distance to other possible sentences weighted by their estimated probability the loss function is usually the levenshtein distance though it can be different distances for specific tasks the set of possible transcriptions is of course pruned to maintain tractability efficient algorithms have been devised to re score lattices represented as weighted finite state transducers with edit distances represented themselves as a finite state transducer verifying certain assumptions dynamic time warping is an approach that was historically used for speech recognition but has now largely been displaced by the more successful hmmbased approach dynamic time warping is an algorithm for measuring similarity between two sequences that may vary in time or speed for instance similarities in walking patterns would be detected even if in one video the person was walking slowly and if in another he or she were walking more quickly or even if there were accelerations and deceleration during the course of one observation dtw has been applied to video audio and graphics indeed any data that can be turned into a linear representation can be analyzed with dtw a wellknown application has been automatic speech recognition to cope with different speaking speeds in general it is a method that allows a computer to find an optimal match between two given sequences eg time series with certain restrictions that is the sequences are warped nonlinearly to match each other this sequence alignment method is often used in the context of hidden markov models neural networks emerged as an attractive acoustic modeling approach in asr in the late 1980s since then neural networks have been used in many aspects of speech recognition such as phoneme classification phoneme classification through multiobjective evolutionary algorithms isolated word recognition audiovisual speech recognition audiovisual speaker recognition and speaker adaptation neural networks make fewer explicit assumptions about feature statistical properties than hmms and have several qualities making them attractive recognition models for speech recognition when used to estimate the probabilities of a speech feature segment neural networks allow discriminative training in a natural and efficient manner however in spite of their effectiveness in classifying shorttime units such as individual phonemes and isolated words early neural networks were rarely successful for continuous recognition tasks because of their limited ability to model temporal dependencies one approach to this limitation was to use neural networks as a preprocessing feature transformation or dimensionality reduction step prior to hmm based recognition however more recently lstm and related recurrent neural networks rnns and time delay neural networkstdnns have demonstrated improved performance in this area deep neural networks and denoising autoencoders are also under investigation a deep feedforward neural network dnn is an artificial neural network with multiple hidden layers of units between the input and output layers similar to shallow neural networks dnns can model complex nonlinear relationships dnn architectures generate compositional models where extra layers enable composition of features from lower layers giving a huge learning capacity and thus the potential of modeling complex patterns of speech data a success of dnns in large vocabulary speech recognition occurred in by industrial researchers in collaboration with academic researchers where large output layers of the dnn based on context dependent hmm states constructed by decision trees were adopted see comprehensive reviews of this development and of the state of the art as of october in the recent springer book from microsoft research see also the related background of automatic speech recognition and the impact of various machine learning paradigms notably including deep learning in recent overview articles one fundamental principle of deep learning is to do away with handcrafted feature engineering and to use raw features this principle was first explored successfully in the architecture of deep autoencoder on the raw spectrogram or linear filterbank features showing its superiority over the melcepstral features which contain a few stages of fixed transformation from spectrograms the true raw features of speech waveforms have more recently been shown to produce excellent largerscale speech recognition results since there has been much research interest in endtoend asr traditional phoneticbased ie all hmmbased model approaches required separate components and training for the pronunciation acoustic and language model endtoend models jointly learn all the components of the speech recognizer this is valuable since it simplifies the training process and deployment process for example a ngram language model is required for all hmmbased systems and a typical ngram language model often takes several gigabytes in memory making them impractical to deploy on mobile devices consequently modern commercial asr systems from google and apple as of are deployed on the cloud and require a network connection as opposed to the device locally the first attempt at endtoend asr was with connectionist temporal classification ctcbased systems introduced by alex graves of google deepmind and navdeep jaitly of the university of toronto in the model consisted of recurrent neural networks and a ctc layer jointly the rnnctc model learns the pronunciation and acoustic model together however it is incapable of learning the language due to conditional independence assumptions similar to a hmm consequently ctc models can directly learn to map speech acoustics to english characters but the models make many common spelling mistakes and must rely on a separate language model to clean up the transcripts later baidu expanded on the work with extremely large datasets and demonstrated some commercial success in chinese mandarin and english in university of oxford presented lipnet the first endtoend sentencelevel lipreading model using spatiotemporal convolutions coupled with an rnnctc architecture surpassing humanlevel performance in a restricted grammar dataset a largescale cnnrnnctc architecture was presented in by google deepmind achieving times better performance than human experts an alternative approach to ctcbased models are attentionbased models attentionbased asr models were introduced simultaneously by chan et al of carnegie mellon university and google brain and bahdanau et al of the university of montreal in the model named listen attend and spell las literally listens to the acoustic signal pays attention to different parts of the signal and spells out the transcript one character at a time unlike ctcbased models attentionbased models do not have conditionalindependence assumptions and can learn all the components of a speech recognizer including the pronunciation acoustic and language model directly this means during deployment there is no need to carry around a language model making it very practical for applications with limited memory by the end of the attentionbased models have seen considerable success including outperforming the ctc models with or without an external language model various extensions have been proposed since the original las model latent sequence decompositions lsd was proposed by carnegie mellon university mit and google brain to directly emit subword units which are more natural than english characters university of oxford and google deepmind extended las to watch listen attend and spell wlas to handle lip reading surpassing humanlevel performance typically a manual control input for example by means of a finger control on the steeringwheel enables the speech recognition system and this is signaled to the driver by an audio prompt following the audio prompt the system has a listening window during which it may accept a speech input for recognition simple voice commands may be used to initiate phone calls select radio stations or play music from a compatible smartphone mp3 player or musicloaded flash drive voice recognition capabilities vary between car make and model some of the most recentwhen car models offer naturallanguage speech recognition in place of a fixed set of commands allowing the driver to use full sentences and common phrases with such systems there is therefore no need for the user to memorize a set of fixed command words in the health care sector speech recognition can be implemented in frontend or backend of the medical documentation process frontend speech recognition is where the provider dictates into a speechrecognition engine the recognized words are displayed as they are spoken and the dictator is responsible for editing and signing off on the document backend or deferred speech recognition is where the provider dictates into a digital dictation system the voice is routed through a speechrecognition machine and the recognized draft document is routed along with the original voice file to the editor where the draft is edited and report finalized deferred speech recognition is widely used in the industry currently one of the major issues relating to the use of speech recognition in healthcare is that the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra provides for substantial financial benefits to physicians who utilize an emr according to meaningful use standards these standards require that a substantial amount of data be maintained by the emr now more commonly referred to as an electronic health record or ehr the use of speech recognition is more naturally suited to the generation of narrative text as part of a radiologypathology interpretation progress note or discharge summary the ergonomic gains of using speech recognition to enter structured discrete data eg numeric values or codes from a list or a controlled vocabulary are relatively minimal for people who are sighted and who can operate a keyboard and mouse a more significant issue is that most ehrs have not been expressly tailored to take advantage of voicerecognition capabilities a large part of the clinicians interaction with the ehr involves navigation through the user interface using menus and tabbutton clicks and is heavily dependent on keyboard and mouse voicebased navigation provides only modest ergonomic benefits by contrast many highly customized systems for radiology or pathology dictation implement voice macros where the use of certain phrases eg normal report will automatically fill in a large number of default values andor generate boilerplate which will vary with the type of the exam eg a chest xray vs a gastrointestinal contrast series for a radiology system prolonged use of speech recognition software in conjunction with word processors has shown benefits to shorttermmemory restrengthening in brain avm patients who have been treated with resection further research needs to be conducted to determine cognitive benefits for individuals whose avms have been treated using radiologic techniques substantial efforts have been devoted in the last decade to the test and evaluation of speech recognition in fighter aircraft of particular note have been the us program in speech recognition for the advanced fighter technology integration aftif16 aircraft f16 vista the program in france for mirage aircraft and other programs in the uk dealing with a variety of aircraft platforms in these programs speech recognizers have been operated successfully in fighter aircraft with applications including setting radio frequencies commanding an autopilot system setting steerpoint coordinates and weapons release parameters and controlling flight display working with swedish pilots flying in the jas39 gripen cockpit englund found recognition deteriorated with increasing gloads the report also concluded that adaptation greatly improved the results in all cases and that the introduction of models for breathing was shown to improve recognition scores significantly contrary to what might have been expected no effects of the broken english of the speakers were found it was evident that spontaneous speech caused problems for the recognizer as might have been expected a restricted vocabulary and above all a proper syntax could thus be expected to improve recognition accuracy substantially the eurofighter typhoon currently in service with the uk raf employs a speakerdependent system requiring each pilot to create a template the system is not used for any safetycritical or weaponcritical tasks such as weapon release or lowering of the undercarriage but is used for a wide range of other cockpit functions voice commands are confirmed by visual andor aural feedback the system is seen as a major design feature in the reduction of pilot workload and even allows the pilot to assign targets to his aircraft with two simple voice commands or to any of his wingmen with only five commands speakerindependent systems are also being developed and are under test for the f35 lightning ii jsf and the alenia aermacchi m346 master leadin fighter trainer these systems have produced word accuracy scores in excess of the problems of achieving high recognition accuracy under stress and noise are particularly relevant in the helicopter environment as well as in the jet fighter environment the acoustic noise problem is actually more severe in the helicopter environment not only because of the high noise levels but also because the helicopter pilot in general does not wear a facemask which would reduce acoustic noise in the microphone substantial test and evaluation programs have been carried out in the past decade in speech recognition systems applications in helicopters notably by the us army avionics research and development activity avrada and by the royal aerospace establishment rae in the uk work in france has included speech recognition in the puma helicopter there has also been much useful work in canada results have been encouraging and voice applications have included control of communication radios setting of navigation systems and control of an automated target handover system as in fighter applications the overriding issue for voice in helicopters is the impact on pilot effectiveness encouraging results are reported for the avrada tests although these represent only a feasibility demonstration in a test environment much remains to be done both in speech recognition and in overall speech technology in order to consistently achieve performance improvements in operational settings training for air traffic controllers atc represents an excellent application for speech recognition systems many atc training systems currently require a person to act as a pseudopilot engaging in a voice dialog with the trainee controller which simulates the dialog that the controller would have to conduct with pilots in a real atc situation speech recognition and synthesis techniques offer the potential to eliminate the need for a person to act as a pseudopilot thus reducing training and support personnel in theory air controller tasks are also characterized by highly structured speech as the primary output of the controller hence reducing the difficulty of the speech recognition task should be possible in practice this is rarely the case the faa document details the phrases that should be used by air traffic controllers while this document gives less than examples of such phrases the number of phrases supported by one of the simulation vendors speech recognition systems is in excess of the usaf usmc us army us navy and faa as well as a number of international atc training organizations such as the royal australian air force and civil aviation authorities in italy brazil and canada are currently using atc simulators with speech recognition from a number of different vendors asr is now commonplace in the field of telephony and is becoming more widespread in the field of computer gaming and simulation in telephony systems asr is now being predominantly used in contact centers by integrating it with ivr systems despite the high level of integration with word processing in general personal computing in the field of document production asr has not seen the expected increases in use the improvement of mobile processor speeds has made speech recognition practical in smartphones speech is used mostly as a part of a user interface for creating predefined or custom speech commands for language learning speech recognition can be useful for learning a second language it can teach proper pronunciation in addition to helping a person develop fluency with their speaking skills students who are blind see blindness and education or have very low vision can benefit from using the technology to convey words and then hear the computer recite them as well as use a computer by commanding with their voice instead of having to look at the screen and keyboard students who are physically disabled or suffer from repetitive strain injuryother injuries to the upper extremities can be relieved from having to worry about handwriting typing or working with scribe on school assignments by using speechtotext programs they can also utilize speech recognition technology to freely enjoy searching the internet or using a computer at home without having to physically operate a mouse and keyboard speech recognition can allow students with learning disabilities to become better writers by saying the words aloud they can increase the fluidity of their writing and be alleviated of concerns regarding spelling punctuation and other mechanics of writing also see learning disability the use of voice recognition software in conjunction with a digital audio recorder and a personal computer running wordprocessing software has proven to be positive for restoring damaged shortterm memory capacity in stroke and craniotomy individuals people with disabilities can benefit from speech recognition programs for individuals that are deaf or hard of hearing speech recognition software is used to automatically generate a closedcaptioning of conversations such as discussions in conference rooms classroom lectures andor religious services speech recognition is also very useful for people who have difficulty using their hands ranging from mild repetitive stress injuries to involve disabilities that preclude using conventional computer input devices in fact people who used the keyboard a lot and developed rsi became an urgent early market for speech recognition speech recognition is used in deaf telephony such as voicemail to text relay services and captioned telephone individuals with learning disabilities who have problems with thoughttopaper communication essentially they think of an idea but it is processed incorrectly causing it to end up differently on paper can possibly benefit from the software but the technology is not bug proof also the whole idea of speak to text can be hard for intellectually disabled persons due to the fact that it is rare that anyone tries to learn the technology to teach the person with the disability this type of technology can help those with dyslexia but other disabilities are still in question the effectiveness of the product is the problem that is hindering it from being effective although a kid may be able to say a word depending on how clear they say it the technology may think they are saying another word and input the wrong one giving them more work to fix causing them to have to take more time with fixing the wrong word the performance of speech recognition systems is usually evaluated in terms of accuracy and speed accuracy is usually rated with word error rate wer whereas speed is measured with the real time factor other measures of accuracy include single word error rate swer and command success rate csr speech recognition by machine is a very complex problem however vocalizations vary in terms of accent pronunciation articulation roughness nasality pitch volume and speed speech is distorted by a background noise and echoes electrical characteristics accuracy of speech recognition may vary with the following as mentioned earlier in this article the accuracy of speech recognition may vary depending on the following factors with discontinuous speech full sentences separated by silence are used therefore it becomes easier to recognize the speech as well as with isolated speech with continuous speech naturally spoken sentences are used therefore it becomes harder to recognize the speech different from both isolated and discontinuous speech constraints are often represented by grammar speech recognition is a multileveled pattern recognition task eg known word pronunciations or legal word sequences which can compensate for errors or uncertainties at a lower level for telephone speech the sampling rate is samples per second computed every ms with one ms section called a frame analysis of fourstep neural network approaches can be explained by further information sound is produced by air or some other medium vibration which we register by ears but machines by receivers basic sound creates a wave which has two descriptions amplitude how strong is it and frequency how often it vibrates per second accuracy can be computed with the help of word error rate wer word error rate can be calculated by aligning the recognized word and referenced word using dynamic string alignment the problem may occur while computing the word error rate due to the difference between the sequence lengths of the recognized word and referenced word let the formula to compute the word error ratewer is while computing the word recognition rate wrr word error rate wer is used and the formula is here h is the number of correctly recognized words h nsd speech recognition can become a means of attack theft or accidental operation for example activation words like alexa spoken in an audio or video broadcast can cause devices in homes and offices to start listening for input inappropriately or possibly take an unwanted action voicecontrolled devices are also accessible to visitors to the building or even those outside the building if they can be heard inside attackers may be able to gain access to personal information like calendar address book contents private messages and documents they may also be able to impersonate the user to send messages or make online purchases two attacks have been demonstrated that use artificial sounds one transmits ultrasound and attempt to send commands without nearby people noticing the other adds small inaudible distortions to other speech or music that are specially crafted to confuse the specific speech recognition system into recognizing music as speech or to make what sounds like one command to a human sound like a different command to the system popular speech recognition conferences held each year or two include speechtek and speechtek europe icassp interspeecheurospeech and the ieee asru conferences in the field of natural language processing such as acl naacl emnlp and hlt are beginning to include papers on speech processing important journals include the ieee transactions on speech and audio processing later renamed ieee transactions on audio speech and language processing and since sept renamed ieeeacm transactions on audio speech and language processingafter merging with an acm publication computer speech and language and speech communication books like fundamentals of speech recognition by lawrence rabiner can be useful to acquire basic knowledge but may not be fully up to date another good source can be statistical methods for speech recognition by frederick jelinek and spoken language processing by xuedong huang etc computer speech by manfred r schroeder second edition published in and speech processing a dynamic and optimizationoriented approach published in by li deng and doug oshaughnessey the updated textbook speech and language processing by jurafsky and martin presents the basics and the state of the art for asr speaker recognition also uses the same features most of the same frontend processing and classification techniques as is done in speech recognition a comprehensive textbook fundamentals of speaker recognition is an in depth source for up to date details on the theory and practice a good insight into the techniques used in the best modern systems can be gained by paying attention to government sponsored evaluations such as those organised by darpa the largest speech recognitionrelated project ongoing as of is the gale project which involves both speech recognition and translation components a good and accessible introduction to speech recognition technology and its history is provided by the general audience book the voice in the machine building computers that understand speech by roberto pieraccini the most recent book on speech recognition is automatic speech recognition a deep learning approach publisher springer written by microsoft researchers d yu and l deng and published near the end of with highly mathematically oriented technical detail on how deep learning methods are derived and implemented in modern speech recognition systems based on dnns and related deep learning methods a related book published earlier in deep learning methods and applications by l deng and d yu provides a less technical but more methodologyfocused overview of dnnbased speech recognition during placed within the more general context of deep learning applications including not only speech recognition but also image recognition natural language processing information retrieval multimodal processing and multitask learning in terms of freely available resources carnegie mellon universitys sphinx toolkit is one place to start to both learn about speech recognition and to start experimenting another
