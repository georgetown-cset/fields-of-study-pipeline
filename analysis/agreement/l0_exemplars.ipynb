developing world and india is the worlds largest producer of bananas and plantains in india eight pests commonly infest the banana crop of these the banana rhizome weevil ie cosmopolites sordidus germar and the banana pseudostem weevil ie odoiporus longicollis oliver are the major pests o longicollis oliver is a monophagous pest of banana and the larvae as well as adults cause severe damage affecting the production of bananas the loss varies from to almost depending on the stage of plant growth at which pest infestation occurs and also the efficiency of the management or cultivation practice that is followed use of conventional breeding to transfer resistance is restricted due to parthenocarpy nonseeded nature and malefemale sterility of the banana plants therefore there is an increasing interest in developing banana cultivars resistant to banana stem weevil using biotechnological approaches a broad integrated pest management strategy has the potential to provide the best strategy for controlling this pest the components of a successful ipm programme would include identifying host plant resistance cultural and biological control study of the population structure of the pest and identifying useful genes whose products would have a detrimental effect on the growth and development of the pest so that a biotechnological approach can be used to develop banana transgenics carrying such genes in this thesis an attempt has been made to study the following two important components which could contribute to the ipm for the control of this pest i study of the population structure of the pest ie assessment of the genetic variation between and within populations and how this variation is partitioned geographically ii identification of useful genes whose products would deter the growth and development of the pest so that these genes could be used in the future for developing banana transgenics with improved toleranceresistance to o longicollis oliver genetic diversity analysis of thirty adult beetles of odoiporus longicollis oliver representing six populations collected from infested banana stems from banana fields in assam kamrup bihar vaishali kerala wayanad maharashtra jalgaon narayangaon and tamilnadu trichy was done using both nuclear and mitochondrial markers including rapds issrs aflps rdna its1 and its2 and coitrnaleucoii markers the data generated using each of these markers has been analysed phylogenetically and statistically to determine the utility of each of these marker systems in genetic diversity analysis the rapds and issrs based upgma dendrograms did not reveal any phylogeographic clustering of the populations the aflp based dendrogram showed a strong correlation between geographic and genetic distance suggesting that aflps are more useful than rapds and issrs in the present study the phylogenetic analysis of the six weevil populations based on the its1 and its2 regions reveals that there is gene flow between these populations and there is no phylogeographical distribution of these six populations among the six populations the assam population is the oldest as i it shows the highest genetic diversity based on the its1 and its2 sequence analysis ii it is separated from the other five populations by a longer branch length in the phylogenetic trees derived by aflps its1 and its2 data this observation supports the initial migration of this pest into india via the northeast from the centre of origin of bananas in southeast asia which is considered to be the primary centre of diversification and earliest domestication of this crop consensus secondary structures of the its1 and its2 regions of o longicolli oliver are also presented the consensus secondary structures of the its2 region conforms to the paneukaryotic model in the its1 secondary structure phylogenetic tree the individuals grouped according to their secondary structures such that each group showed specific structural characteristics the phylogenetic trees based on the secondary structures of its1 and its2 of the thirty o longicollis oliver individuals were congruent though the secondary structure of these two regions bears no resemblance to each other suggesting that secondary structures of these two regions are important markers in phylogenetic analysis the present study of the secondary structure of the its1 and its2 regions of o longicollis oliver and its use in assessing the phylogenetic relationships is the first detailed report for insects in particular family curculionidae sequence analysis of the

observed in insect mitochondrial genes there was no phylogeographic distribution of the populations the fu and lis d and f tests were nonsignificant for this mitochondrial region no wolbachia infection was detected in any of the populations the genetic differentiation amongst the populations was highly significant p0001 df75 suggesting restricted gene flow between the populations this result did not correlate with that obtained with nuclear markers ie its1 and its2 suggesting a malebiased gene flow between the populations alphaamylases and proteinases are important digestive enzymes which play a central role in the digestive metabolism in those insects that live on seeds and plant parts the larvae and adults of banana pseudostem weevil feed voraciously on the stem parts and complete their development within the stem hence they depend to a large extent on their proteinases and alphaamylases for their survival the purified monomeric and dimeric alphaamylase inhibitor fractions from a local variety of wheat seeds completely inhibit the alpha amylase activity from this pest and do not inhibit porcine pancreatic amylase and human salivary amylase these characteristics make these inhibitors attractive candidates for genetic engineering to develop banana transgenics with improved tolerance towards banana stem weevil in this thesis cloning of the partial gene encoding the amylase the cloned segment includes all the conserved regions and the catalytic domain and cloning of the genes encoding the monomeric and dimeric amylase inhibitors from a local variety of wheat has been described the molecular basis of the specificity of inhibition between the amylase and the inhibitors has been studied by homology modeling such a study is the first

      "     novel approaches to systematically evaluating and constructing call graphs for java software whether applications or libraries todays software heavily reuses existing code to build more gigantic software faster to ensure a smooth user experience for an applications enduser and a reliable software library for the developer the shipped piece of software should be as bugfree as possible besides manual or automatic software testing static program analysis is one possible way to find unintended behavior while static analysis tools can detect simple problems using pattern matching advanced problems often require complex interprocedural control and dataflow analyses which in turn presume call graphs for example call graphs enable static analyses to track inputs over method boundaries to find sqlinjections or null pointer dereferences the research community proposed many different callgraph algorithms with different precision and scalability properties however the following three aspects are often neglected first a comprehensive understanding of unsoundness sources their relevance and the capabilities of existing callgraph algorithms in this respect is missing these sources of unsoundness can originate from programming language features and core apis that impact callgraph construction eg reflection but are not entirely modeled by the callgraph algorithm without understanding the sources of unsoundness relevance and the frequency in which they occur it is impossible to estimate their immediate effect on either the call graph or the analysis relying on it second most callgraph research examines how to build call graphs for applications neglecting to investigate the peculiarities of building call graphs for libraries however the use of libraries is ubiquitous in software development consequently disregarding callgraph construction for libraries is unfortunate for both library users and developers as it is crucial to ensure that their library behaves as intended regardless of its usage third callgraph algorithms are traditionally organized in an imperative monolithic style ie one superanalysis computes the whole graph such a design can hardly hold up to the task as different programs and analysis problems require the support for different subsets of language features and apis moreover configuring the algorithm to ones needs is not easy for instance adding removing and exchanging support for individual features to tradeoff the call graphs precision scalability and soundiness to address the first aspect we propose a method and a corresponding toolchain for both a understanding sources of unsoundness and b improving the soundness of call graphs we use our approach to assess multiple callgraph algorithms from stateof theart static analysis frameworks furthermore we study how these features occur in realworld applications and the effort to improve a call graphs soundness regarding aspect two we show that the current practice of using callgraph algorithms designed for applications to analyze libraries leads to call graphs that both a lack relevant call edges and b contain unnecessary edges ergo motivating the need for callgraph construction algorithms dedicated to libraries unlike algorithms for applications callgraph construction algorithms for libraries must consider the goals of subsequent analyses concretely we show that it is essential to distinguish between the analysiss usage scenario whereas an analysis searching for potentially exploitable vulnerabilities must be conservative an analysis for general software quality attributes eg dead methods or unused fields can safely apply optimizations since building one call graph that fits all needs is nonsensical we propose two concrete algorithms each addressing one use case concerning the third aspect we devise a generic approach for collaborative static analysis featuring modular analysis that are independently compilable exchangeable and extensible in particular we decouple mutually dependent analyses enabling their isolated development this approach facilitates highly configurable callgraph algorithms allowing pluggable precision scalability and soundiness by either switching analysis modules for features and apis onoff or exchanging their implementations by addressing these three aspects we advance the stateoftheart in callgraph construction in multiple dimensions first our systematic assessment of unsoundness sources and callgraph algorithms reveals import limitations with stateoftheart all frameworks lack support for many features frequently found inthewild and produce vastly different cgs rendering comparisons of callgraphbased static analyses infeasible furthermore we leave both developers and users of call graphs with suggestions that improve the entire situation second our discussion concerning library call graphs raises the awareness of considering the analysis scenario and opens up a new facet in callgraph research third by featuring modular callgraph algorithms we ease to design implement and test them additionally it allows projectbased configurations enabling

evidence of the illhealth effects of air pollutants gaseous and particulate the monitoring of aerosol concentrations becomes a high environmental priority particularly in urban areas they have several local and global environmental impacts at the regional level they reduces the visibility in the form of haze and to acid deposition at the global level they play a role in climate change so it is very important to monitor air quality it is done with networks of ground monitoring stations and the use of various dispersion models that evaluate emissions and predict changes in air quality at separate points the increasing availability of earth observing satellite systems and onboard imaging sensors together with advances in digital image processing techniques provide a new avenue to monitor urban air quality at a local and regional scale various air pollution dispersion models being used to predict the pollution load of an area for the current period and predict for the future these models can be use in combination with the satellite models to have a good idea about any area this chapter highlight the use of various air pollution dispersion models and its combination with satellite helps in determination of air quality of any area particularly remote areas introduction in india pollution has become a great topic of debate at all levels among various types of pollution air pollution is having great concern and it is because of the enhanced anthropogenic activities such as burning of fossil fuels ie natural gas coal and oil to power industrial processes and automobiles motor vehicles etc it is one of the most critical environmental problems in developing countries and it is the outcome of economic development rapid industrialization and the demand for energy air quality is important simply because we cannot avoid breathing in the air around us the average adult breathes in about cubic meters or litres of air a day the air we breathe is a mixture of gases and small solid and liquid particles it has been a widely recognised problem and becomes a basic problem in todays world this emits wide variety of air pollutants particularly carbon monoxide co oxides of nitrogen nox volatile organic compounds vocs particulate matter pm and sulphur dioxide so2 ozcan the relative abundances of these atmospheric components in particulate matter are temporally and spatially highly variable some of them are directly emitted into the atmosphere by both natural and anthropogenic sources primary particles while some others are the result of homogeneous or heterogeneous nucleation and condensation of gaseous precursors secondary particles murillo et al chan and kwok morawska and zhang air pollution management management of air quality is done by selecting strategic locations and monitoring the concentration of pollutants by using ground based instruments on those locations which are costly and lacking in spatial continuity and these instruments are quite expensive and the coverage is limited by the number of the air pollutant station in each area so they cannot provide a good spatial distribution of air pollutant readings over a cityarea in addition measuring stations may not be readily available in remote areas and developing countries gupta et al the atmosphere affects satellite images of the earths surface in the solar spectrum so the signal observe by the satellite sensor was the sum of the effects from the ground and atmosphere tropospheric aerosols act to significantly alter the earths radiation budget but quantification of the change in radiation is difficult because atmospheric aerosol distributions vary greatly in type size space and time penner et al remote sensing capabilities are being explored in the area of air pollution monitoring and management it offers a platform for creating an inventory database and thematic map for air pollution studies it is used to graphically illustrate the spatial patterns of emissions from

emission sources and meteorological scenario land use terrain meteorological data and a measure of the total atmospheric concentration of the metrics in the model domain johnson et al dubey et al and mark et al it uses meteorological data such as temperature mixing height wind direction and wind speed to calculate concentrations this is used for various gaseous and particulate pollutants in the

      "     sources of methane and nitrous oxide in californias central valley estimated through direct airborne flux and positive matrix factorization source apportionment of groundbased and regional tall tower measurements authors guha abhinav advisors goldstein allen h abstract methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o are two major greenhouse gases that contribute significantly to the increase in anthropogenic radiativeforcing causing perturbations to the earths climate system in a watershed moment in the states history of environmental leadership and commitment california in opted for sharp reductions in their greenhouse gas ghg emissions and adopted a longterm approach to address climate change that includes regulation of emissions from individual emitters and source categories there are large ch4 and n2o emissions sources in the state predominantly in the agricultural and waste management sector while these two gases account for l of total annual greenhouse gas emissions of the state large uncertainties exist in their bottomup accounting in the state ghg inventory additionally an increasing number of topdown studies based on ambient observations point towards underestimation of their emissions in the inventory three intensive field observation campaigns that were spatially and temporally diverse took place between and in the central valley of california where the largest known sources of ch4 and n2o eg agricultural systems and dairies and potentially significant ch4 sources eg oil and gas extraction are located the calnex california nexus research at the nexus of air quality and climate change field campaign during summer may june took place in the urban core of bakersfield in the southern san joaquin valley a city whose economy is built around agriculture and the oil and gas industry during summer of airborne measurements were performed over a large spatial domain all across and around the central valley as part of the cabernet california airborne bvoc emission research in natural ecosystem transects study next a oneyear continuous field campaign wgc june august was conducted at the walnut grove tall tower near the sacramentosan joaquin river delta in the central valley through analysis of these field measurements this dissertation presents the apportionment of observed ch4 and n2o concentration enhancements into major source categories along with direct emissions estimates from airborne observations we perform highprecision measurements of greenhouse gases using gas analyzers based on absorption spectroscopy and other source marker volatile organic compounds vocs using state of the art voc measurement systems eg proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry we combine these measurements with a statistical source apportionment technique called positive matrix factorization pmf to evaluate and investigate the major local sources of ch4 and n2o during calnex and walnut grove campaigns in the cabernet study we combine measurements with an airborne approach to a wellestablished micrometeorological technique eddycovariance method to derive ch4 fluxes over different source regions in the central valley in the calnex experiments we demonstrate that dairy and livestock remains the largest source sector of nonco2 greenhouse gases in the san joaquin valley contributing most of the ch4 and much of the measured n2o at bakersfield agriculture is observed to provide another major source of n2o while vehicle emissions are found to be an insignificant source of n2o contrary to the current statewide greenhouse gas inventory which includes vehicles as a major source our pmf source apportionment also produces an evaporativefugitive factor but its relative lack of ch4 contributions points to removal processes from vented emissions in the surrounding oag industry and the overwhelming dominance of the dairy ch4 source in the cabernet experiments we report enhancements of ch4 from a number of sources spread across the spatial domain of the central valley that improves our understanding of their distribution and relative strengths we observe large enhancements of ch4 mixing ratios over the dairy and feedlot intensive regions of central valley corresponding with significant flux estimates that are larger than ch4 emission rates reported in the greenhouse gas inventory we find evidence of significant ch4 emissions from fugitive andor vented sources and cogeneration plants in the oil and gas fields of kern county all of which are minor to insignificant ch4 sources in the current greenhouse gas inventory the cabernet campaign represents the first successful implementation of airborne eddy covariance technique for ch4 flux measurements at walnut grove we demonstrate the seasonal and temporal dependence of ch4 and n2o sources in the central valley applying pmf analysis on seasonal ghgvoc data sets we again identify dairies and livestock as the dominant source of ch4 a clear temporal dependence of emissions originating from a wetlands delta ch4 source is observed while ch4 contributions are also observed from a source originating from upwind urban and natural gas extraction activities the agricultural soil management source of n2o has a seasonal dependence coincident with the agricultural growing season and hence fertilizer use accounting for a majority of the n2o enhancements during spring and summers but being reduced to a negligible source during late fall and winters when manure management n2o emissions from dairy and livestock dominate the relative distribution n2o is absent from the urban source in contrast to the significant contribution to the statewide n2o inventory from vehicle emissions the application of greenhouse gas source apportionment using voc tracers as identification tools at two independent sites in the central valley over vastly different temporal resolutions provide significant insights into the regional distribution of major ch4 sources direct airborne eddy covariance measurements provide a unique opportunity to constrain ch4 emissions in the central valley over regional spatial scales that are not directly observable by groundbased methods airborne observations provide identification of hotspots and underinventoried ch4 sources while airborne eddy covariance enables quantification of emissions from those area sources that are largely composed of arbitrarily located minor point sources eg dairies and oil fields the topdown analysis provides confirmation of the dominance of dairy and livestock source for methane emissions in california minor but significant contributions to methane emissions are observed from oil and gas extraction rice cultivation and wetlands the estimates for these sectors being either negligible eg wetlands or highly uncertain eg oil and gas extraction in the statewide inventories and probably underestimated as a proportion of the total inventory the topdown analysis also confirms agricultural soil management and dairy and livestock as the two principal sources of n2o consistent with the inventory but shows that n2o contributions attributed to the transportation sector are overestimated in the statewide inventory these new top down constraints should be used to correct these errors in the current bottomup inventory which is a critical step for future assessments of the efficacy of emission reduction regulations particularly measurement techniques like vehicle dynamometer emission calculations for transportation sources sourcespecific short range groundbased inverse dispersion for dairy and livestock sources airborne eddy covariance and airborne mass balance approach based emissions estimation over oil and gas fields and ground based eddycovariance for wetlands and agriculture sector can be used effectively to generate direct emissions estimates for methane and nitrous oxide that help update and improve the accuracy of the state inventory\n",

      "     new perspectives on welfare and governance in contemporary china over the last thirty years china has undergone comprehensive and profound social and economic transformation the rapid development of urbanization marketization informatization and globalization has brought china a series of major challenges these include how to adjust the relationship between the state market and society how to narrow the gap between rich and poor how to build and improve the social welfare system how to protect and improve the ecological environment and how to reform and innovate the system of government and governance at the same time britain on the other side of the world faces serious problems such as its departure from the eu declining trust in government refugee crises and problems of social integration and the retrenchment of the social welfare system as a popular adage says to learn from others experience can better oneself in the era of globalization chinas road of modernization is not only inseparable from the experience of developed countries but also provides the world with a unique insight on development and welfare one with a chinese flavour international academic exchanges and cooperation are important parts of the internationalization process in order to promote academic exchange and cooperation between china and britain scholars from the institute of sociology of the chinese academy of social sciences led by dr xiao lin and the school of social science of cardiff university led by professor sin yi cheung successfully secured funding from the british academy under the cassba newton advanced fellowship scheme in the broad theme of the project was social welfare and local governance a comparative perspective between china and britain along with social policy and local governance developments in europe and china : social science academic press beijing the four papers in this publication are key outputs from the casscardiff university collaboration written by leading cass scholars each paper provides new insights into issues of welfare development and urbanization in contemporary china by engaging with these issues the chapters in this volume provide a timely empirically grounded engagement with a raft of social theory foremost is the burgeoning body of academic work on governance towards the end of the twentieth century new ways of governing emerged in western countries that involved greater use of nonstate actors the term governance is now employed to capture the idea that governing does not rest on the authority and sanction of government alone gouldson and bebbington bevir this results in various forms of publicprivatevoluntary collaboration including the use of private market and civil society actors for the delivery of social goods these are variously captured in the associated literature on welfare pluralism chaney and wincott and new public governance osbourne importantly work on multilevel bache and flinders and multispatial governance jessop underlines how the form and function of governance varies according to geographical scale ranging from international national and subnational or regional processes to those operating at the local or community level the prevailing mix of governance styles can also differ across policy sectors and countries as well as change over time baker this is evident in the allied literature on welfare state theory pierson and castles leibfried and mau which provides critical insight into the role of the state in promoting citizen wellbeing and the provision of social welfare this literature however has been largely dominated by studies of western states arts and gelissen chau and sam especially where strong neoliberal belief in the effectiveness and efficiency of markets shapes the mix of governance styles used newman and mckee in response this volume analyses developments in the east china presents an interesting and important case where civil society is less autonomous from the state hsu and hasmath although civil society in china cannot be understood in conventional terms the drive towards economic reform and modernization in the past years has created new opportunities for citizen participation kerr here new participatory practices socialize people into an ethic of citizenship such as through the provision of social care at the community level ringen and ngok yet the case of china also exhibits strong similarities to the west where the state continues to act both as a coordinator and facilitator while retaining its traditional regulatory and oversight roles carrillo garcia beatriz hood and kadetz the evidence from our empirical work on china shows how as this change in governmentality plays out in practice the openingup of social spaces can both strengthen the bonds between the state and the polity while simultaneously enhancing the capacity of the state to deliver on social goods sander et al the research also points to the complexity of the relationship between civil society and the state and the need to think differently about how it is forged and developed outside western contexts these articles reflect the finished product after months of hard work of the cass team and helpful comments and advice from senior colleagues of the cardiff team the editing and publishing of these working papers stand among the concrete achievements of our three years communication and cooperation we hope to use it as an opportunity to contribute our humble effort to promote international exchange and expand our academic horizons in related fields\n",
