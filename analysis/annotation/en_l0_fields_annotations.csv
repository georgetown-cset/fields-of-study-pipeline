carticle_0000800584,Scatter and crosstalk corrections for (99m)Tc/(123)I dual-radionuclide imaging using a CZT SPECT system with pinhole collimators,"Purpose: The energy spectrum for a cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) detector has a low energy tail due to incomplete charge collection and intercrystal scattering. Due to these solid-state detector effects, scatter would be overestimated if the conventional triple-energy window (TEW) method is used for scatter and crosstalk corrections in CZT-based imaging systems. The objective of this work is to develop a scatter and crosstalk correction method for Tc-99m/I-123 dual-radionuclide imaging for a CZT-based dedicated cardiac SPECT system with pinhole collimators (GE Discovery NM 530c/570c).
Methods: A tailing model was developed to account for the low energy tail effects of the CZT detector. The parameters of the model were obtained using Tc-99m and I-123 point source measurements. A scatter model was defined to characterize the relationship between down-scatter and self-scatter projections. The parameters for this model were obtained from Monte Carlo simulation using SIMIND. The tailing and scatter models were further incorporated into a projection count model, and the primary and self-scatter projections of each radionuclide were determined with a maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) iterative estimation approach. The extracted scatter and crosstalk projections were then incorporated into MLEM image reconstruction as an additive term in forward projection to obtain scatter-and crosstalk-corrected images. The proposed method was validated using Monte Carlo simulation, line source experiment, anthropomorphic torso phantom studies, and patient studies. The performance of the proposed method was also compared to that obtained with the conventional TEW method.
Results: Monte Carlo simulations and line source experiment demonstrated that the TEW method overestimated scatter while their proposed method provided more accurate scatter estimation by considering the low energy tail effect. In the phantom study, improved defect contrasts were observed with both correction methods compared to no correction, especially for the images of 99mTc in dual-radionuclide imaging where there is heavy contamination from 123I. In this case, the nontransmural defect contrast was improved from 0.39 to 0.47 with the TEW method and to 0.51 with their proposed method and the transmural defect contrast was improved from 0.62 to 0.74 with the TEW method and to 0.73 with their proposed method. In the patient study, the proposed method provided higher myocardium-to-blood pool contrast than that of the TEW method. Similar to the phantom experiment, the improvement was the most substantial for the images of Tc-99m in dual-radionuclide imaging. In this case, the myocardium-to-blood pool ratio was improved from 7.0 to 38.3 with the TEW method and to 63.6 with their proposed method. Compared to the TEW method, the proposed method also provided higher count levels in the reconstructed images in both phantom and patient studies, indicating reduced overestimation of scatter. Using the proposed method, consistent reconstruction results were obtained for both single-radionuclide data with scatter correction and dual-radionuclide data with scatter and crosstalk corrections, in both phantom and human studies.
Conclusions: The authors demonstrate that the TEW method leads to overestimation in scatter and crosstalk for the CZT-based imaging system while the proposed scatter and crosstalk correction method can provide more accurate self-scatter and down-scatter estimations for quantitative single-radionuclide and dual-radionuclide imaging.

Due to drug-drug interaction potentials, in the current study we aimed to evaluate potent effects of HCT and AML on pharmacokinetics (PKs) of VAL when they are orally co-administered as FDC (VAL/HCT at 80/12.5 mg or 160/12.5 mg; and VAL/AML at 160/5 mg or 160/10 mg) products in healthy Korean subjects. Population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling and analysis were performed by the nonlinear mixed-effects modeling software. PKs of VAL was described by two-compartment disposition model, first-order elimination, four-sequential first-order absorption model, correlation between apparent clearances and volumes of distribution, and lag time. For all FDCs, there were no statistically significant differences in both maximum concentration and areas under the concentration-time curves (AUCs) of VAL in comparison to those when administered VAL alone, except the combination of VAL/AML at 160/10 mg, where AUC<sub>0-∞</sub> increased by 11.8% in mean and 6.86% in median. In addition, there was an increasing trend in time to reach peak (T<sub>max</sub>) of VAL in FDCs, where it was increased by 0.22-0.34 h in mean and 0.40-0.44 h in median, except the combination of VAL/HCT at 160/12.5 mg. However, these differences in AUC<sub>0-∞</sub> and T<sub>max</sub> might not be considered as clinically important. In conclusion, HCT or AML has no potent effect on PKs of VAL when they are co-administered as FDC products. No dose adjustment for VAL is recommended when co-administered with HCT or AML.",Should medicine always be bio?

carticle_0002292713,Pore network model of primary freeze drying,"The pore scale progression of the sublimation front during primary freeze drying depends on the local vapor transport and the local heat transfer as well. If the pore space is size distributed, vapor and heat transfer may spatially vary. Beyond that, the pore size distribution can substantially affect the physics of the transport mechanisms if they occur in a transitional regime. Exemplarily, if the critical mean free path is locally exceeded, the vapor transport regime passes from viscous flow to Knudsen diffusion. At the same time, the heat transfer is affected by the local ratio of pore space to the solid skeleton. The impact of the pore size distribution on the transitional vapor and heat transfer can be studied by pore scale models such as the pore network model. As a first approach, we present a pore network model with vapor transport in the transitional regime between Knudsen diffusion and viscous flow at constant temperature in the dry region. We demonstrate the impact of pore size distribution, temperature and pressure on the vapor transport regimes. Then we study on the example of a 2D square lattice, how the presence of micro and macro pores affects the macroscopic progression of the sublimation front.   Keywords: pore size distribution; transitional vapor transport; pore network model; fractured sublimation front.",,['Physics'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False

Material and Method: This study retrospectively reviewed the CMIA results of pregnant women attending the antenatal care clinic, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. Women with reactive CMIA results were extracted from the laboratory database and further analyzed. A reactive/positive result for Treponema pallidum was defined as having a sample/cut-off absorbance ratio of >1.0. Samples were also tested by rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TPPA). Results: From February 2011 to January 2013, a total of 11,640 pregnant women were tested and 65 women (0.56%) had reactive CMIA results. Among these cases, 58 women (89.2%) had non-reactive RPR results. TPPA were non-reactive in 35 women (60.3%) who had non-reactive RPR results. A total of 23 women (39.7%) with RPR non-reactive and TPPA reactive results; therefore, the prevalence rate of syphilis in this population was estimated as 1.98 per 1,000 pregnant women. Among this, 7 cases had a history of past, partial treatment for syphilis and 16 cases were considered as untreated, late, latent syphilis. If RPR tests were used as the screening test, 16/23 cases (69.6%) cases with untreated syphilis would be missed. Conclusion: Even though CMIA has high false positive results, however it is still recommended that this reverse sequence screening be used instead of the traditional algorithm. The rate of false positive results can be decreased by adjusting the sample/cut-off absorbance ratio of CMIA.

Two heated sections with different internal diameter (10 and 6 mm) were tested. The power applied on the heated section wall was controlled in increasing and decreasing sequences, and temperature along the section, mass flow rate and pressure drop evolutions were registered. The post-CHF regime was studied watching simultaneously the evolution of boiling crisis onset along the test section and the evolution of pressure drop and mass flow rate. A significant lessening of friction was observed simultaneous to the development of the post-CHF regime, accompanied by a mass flow rate increase, which lets suppose that the vapor film in the film boiling regime acts as a lubricant. A model was created based on this idea and on heat transfer considerations. The predictions by this model are satisfactory for the low quality post-CHF regime. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Studies have identified the importance of side effects in determining preferences, but noted that methodological limitations precluded further investigation of additional attributes such as hepatic and renal toxicity. Objective: Following on from a feasibility study of adaptive choice-based conjoint (ACBC) analysis, the aim of this study was to evaluate 8 medication attributes for the pharmaceutical treatment of osteoarthritis (OA). Setting and Participants : Eleven participants were recruited from members of a Research Users’ Group (RUG) who had been diagnosed with osteoarthritis. RUG members individually complete the ACBC task. Main outcome measures : The relative importance of each attribute and the utilities (part-worth) of each level of each attribute were estimated using ACBC built-in Hierarchical Bayes (HB). Results: The combined relative importance of the 4 risk side-effect attributes when selecting osteoarthritis medication (kidney and liver side effects, heart attack and stroke side effects, stomach side effects and addiction) was 66% while the effectiveness attribute accounted for 8% of the relative importance of the medication decision. Conclusions: In this study, the gap between relative importance of 4 side-effect attributes and expected benefit was 66% vs 8%. These preliminary findings indicate that OA patients are most concerned with the avoidance of adverse events and that there is a threshold above which expected benefit has little impact on patients’ medication preferences.

In all species up to date, oocyte activation requires a fertilization-associated increase in the intracellular concentration of calcium. Especially in mammals, the signal of intracellular calcium rise at fertilization consists of periodical rises, which are also referred to as calcium oscillations. Our recent results suggest that these calcium oscillations have an important role in not only oocyte activation but also development of mammals. Pigs are animals of great agricultural value and ones in which assisted reproductive techniques, including somatic cell nuclear transfer, to produce gene-modified pigs. Although reconstructed embryos require artificial activation stimuli which mimic fertilization-associated increase of intracellular calcium in the oocytes, it has been known that the developmental ability of the oocytes after artificial activation is low and the regimen seems to be required for improvement. Recently we focused on two molecules, phospholipase C zeta and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor which have important roles in regulation of calcium oscillations during fertilization in mammals, including pigs.

The greatest positive effect was with Nereis buried in kaolinite, and the greatest negative effect was with Nereis buried in montmorillonite, a morphological trend paralleled by levels of preserved protein. Similar but more attenuated effects were observed with Crangon. The complex interplay of original histology and sediment mineralogy controls system pH, oxygen content, and major ion concentrations, all of which are likely to feed back on the preservation potential of particular substrates in particular environments. The particular susceptibility of Nereis to both diagenetically enhanced preservation and diagenetically enhanced decomposition most likely derives from the relative lability of its collagenous cuticle vs. the inherently more recalcitrant cuticle of Crangon. We propose a mechanism of secondary, sediment-induced taphonomic tanning to account for instances of enhanced preservation. In light of the marked effects of sediment mineralogy on fossilization, the Cambrian to Early Ordovician taphonomic window for BST preservation is potentially related to a coincident interval of glauconite-prone seas.",,['Geology'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Of note is that oxidative stress in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), where sympathetic premotor neurons reside, contributes to sympathoexcitation and hypertension. This study sought to identify the source of tissue oxidative stress in RVLM and their roles in neural mechanism of hypertension associated with MetS. Adult normotensive rats subjected to a high-fructose diet for 8 weeks developed metabolic traits of MetS, alongside increases in sympathetic vasomotor activity and blood pressure. In RVLM of these MetS rats, the tissue level of reactive oxygen species was increased, nitric oxide (NO) was decreased, and mitochondrial electron transport capacity was reduced. Whereas the protein expression of neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) or protein inhibitor of nNOS was increased, the ratio of nNOS dimer/monomer was significantly decreased. Oral intake of pioglitazone or intracisternal infusion of tempol or coenzyme Q(10) significantly abrogated all those molecular events in high-fructose diet-fed rats and ameliorated sympathoexcitation and hypertension. Gene silencing of protein inhibitor of nNOS mRNA in RVLM using lentivirus carrying small hairpin RNA inhibited protein inhibitor of nNOS expression, increased the ratio of nNOS dimer/monomer, restored NO content, and alleviated oxidative stress in RVLM of high-fructose diet-fed rats, alongside significantly reduced sympathoexcitation and hypertension.

We address problems of this type within a general framework where the regularization term is split into two parts, one being a spectral function while the other is arbitrary. A Douglas-Rachford approach is proposed to address such problems, and a list of proximity operators is provided allowing us to consider various choices for the fit-to-data functional and for the regularization term. Based on our theoretical results, two novel approaches are proposed for the noisy graphical lasso problem, where a covariance or precision matrix has to be statistically estimated in presence of noise. The Douglas-Rachford approach directly applies to the estimation of the covariance matrix. When the precision matrix is sought, we solve a non convex optimization problem. More precisely, we propose a majorization-minimization approach building a sequence of convex surrogates and solving the inner optimization subproblems via the aforementioned Douglas-Rachford procedure.

On continent, there is no clear difference in lithospheric mantle (LM) density between the cratonic and Phanerozoic Europe, yet an ~300‐km‐wide zone of a high‐density LM along the Trans‐European Suture Zone may image a paleosubduction. Kimberlite provinces of the Baltica and Greenland cratons have a low‐density (3.32 g/cm3) mantle where all non‐damondiferous kimberlites tend to a higher‐density (3.34 g/cm3) anomalies. LM density correlates with the depth of sedimentary basins implying that mantle densification plays an important role in basin subsidence. A very dense (3.40–3.45 g/cm3) mantle beneath the superdeep platform basins and the East Barents shelf requires the presence of 10–20% of eclogite, while the West Barents Basin has LM density of 3.35 g/cm3 similar to the Variscan massifs of western Europe.

carticle_0009785193,Prognostic factor analysis of vitrectomy for myopic foveoschisis,"Purpose To describe the anatomical and functional outcomes in a cohort of subjects undergoing vitrectomy for myopic foveoschisis, and to analyse the factors predicting foveal reattachment and visual improvement.
Methods This retrospective case series evaluated case records and optical coherence tomography images 6 months after surgery. Multivariate linear and logistic regressions were performed to assess the factors predicting anatomical and visual improvement.
Results In total, 55 eyes of 54 patients were analysed. The mean spherical equivalent refraction was -11.83 +/-4.94D. Foveal detachment was present in 63.5% of eyes preoperatively and subjects with foveal detachment had 0.70 logMAR units (95% CI 0.02 to 1.39) poorer visual acuity than subjects without (p=0.046). The mean preoperative visual acuity was 0.84+/-0.59 logMAR units and the mean postoperative visual acuity was 0.64 0.64 logMAR units (mean difference 0.20+/-0.68 logMAR units (p=0.04)). The proportion of eyes with foveal detachment was significantly lower after surgery (12.5%; p&lt;0.001). However, the proportion of eyes with ellipsoid zone disruption was significantly higher after surgery (59.6% vs 34.0%; p&lt;0.001). In multivariate analyses, the preoperative central foveal thickness significantly predicted postoperative visual improvement by two or more lines (OR 1.004 (95% CI 1.000 to 1.007), per pm increase; p=0.049). The presence of ellipsoid zone disruption preoperatively was associated with 0.96 logMAR (95% CI 0.2 to 1.72) poorer final acuity (p=0.02).
Conclusions Eyes with myopic foveoschisis with preoperative ellipsoid disruption and thinner central foveal thickness tend to have poorer visual outcomes. While current surgical manoeuvres are effective in reattaching the fovea, they may also cause iatrogenic injury to the photoreceptors.",,['Medicine'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False

Retrospective analysis based on satellite data,"The results of a retrospective analysis of radar and optical satellite data, conducted to assess the ice situation in the Kerch Strait for the period 1999-2017, are presented. It was revealed that for the 2000s the cold winters became more frequent in comparison with previous years, and ice formation occurred in a later period, mainly in late January-early February, but in certain years, for example, in 2012, ice was observed until mid-March. With a decrease in air temperature and a strong wind of the northeastern and eastern directions, the formation of the ice cover in the strait occurred very rapidly, and when the southern cyclones penetrated the ice melted quickly. As a rule, several waves of cold were observed during one winter, each led to the formation of a new ice cover. Particular attention is paid to the analysis of the ice situation in January-February 2017 and to the assessment of the influence of the structures of the Crimean Bridge on the propagation of drifting ice. Before the construction of the Bridge across the Kerch Strait in the cold winters, ice drifted freely from the Sea of Azov to the south along the western coast of the strait, and the construction of the bridge significantly influenced the drift of the ice. Two waves of cold that reached the Sea of Azov in late January and in the first half of February 2017 led to the formation of ice on almost the entire sea area, and then to its cohesion and drift to the southern part of the sea due to the strong northward winds. As a result the Kerch Strait was packed with ice, which was not drifted to the Black Sea because the Crimean Bridge plays the role of the dam, which does not allow the ice to pass through itself (between the supports of the bridge). Consecutive daily satellite radar and optical images of high spatial resolution, obtained in the period from 4 to 17 February 2017, made it possible to trace in detail the interaction of the ice cover of the Sea of Azov and the Crimean Bridge under construction. It is a certain concern about the fact that the ice does not pass between the pillars of the bridge and all the ice mass (with northerly winds of 10-15 m/s and currents of 30-40 cm/s) pressures on the support. It is not known whether this effect was foreseen and numerically modeled by experts when the bridge was designed, but it is clear that now the Crimean Bridge requires annual satellite monitoring of ice conditions.",,['Environmental science'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

The contribution of the GaMampa wetland to dry-season flow in the Mohlapitsi River and the impact of increasing agriculture on its hydrological functioning were investigated. Economic analyses showed that the net financial value of the wetland was US$ 83 263 of which agriculture comprises 38%. Hydrological analyses indicated that the Mohlapitsi River contributes, on average, 16% of the dry-season flow in the Olifants River. However, the wetland contributes, at most, 12% to the increase in dry-season flow observed over the reach of the river in which the wetland is located. The remainder of the increase originates from groundwater flowing through the wetland. Furthermore, despite the conversion of 50% of the wetland to agriculture since 2001, there has been no statistically significant reduction in dry-season flow in the Mohlapitsi River.

Experimental,"In order to provide accurate information for refining of steel containing more than 1 mass pct Al, previously known information about Al deoxidation equilibria in liquid iron was critically reviewed. New Al deoxidation equilibria, Al and O contents in liquid iron in equilibrium with solid Al2O3 were measured at 1873 K and 1923 K (1600 degrees C and 1650 degrees C) over the whole Al composition range, 0.0027 &lt; [pct Al] &lt; 100. In order to secure the deoxidation equilibria, in the present study, the Al deoxidation experiments were carried out by employing three different methods: (1) traditional Al deoxidation by the addition of Al into Fe-O alloys, (2) oxidation of Al in Fe-Al alloys by the addition of Fe2O3 as an oxygen source, and (3) addition of CaO flux for an effective removal of suspended Al2O3 inclusions in liquid alloys containing high Al. In addition, in the present study, the O solubility limit in pure Al melt in equilibrium with solid Al2O3 was also measured in the temperature range from 1673 K to 1873 K (1400 degrees C to 1600 degrees C). The present experimental results provide a complete set of Al deoxidation equilibria in liquid iron which may be useful for the estimation of residual oxygen level and alumina inclusion formation in high Al steel processing. Interaction parameter formalism, which was originally proposed by Wagner and Chipman and has been widely used to interpret the Al deoxidation equilibria in liquid iron, was found to be inapplicable.

carticle_0016399203,Contact angles and wettability of ionic liquids on polar and non-polar surfaces,"Many applications involving ionic liquids (ILs) require the knowledge of their interfacial behaviour, such as wettability and adhesion. In this context, herein, two approaches were combined aiming at understanding the impact of the IL chemical structures on their wettability on both polar and non-polar surfaces, namely: (i) the experimental determination of the contact angles of a broad range of ILs (covering a wide number of anions of variable polarity, cations, and cation alkyl side chain lengths) on polar and non-polar solid substrates (glass, Al-plate, and poly-(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE)); and (ii) the correlation of the experimental contact angles with the cation–anion pair interaction energies generated by the Conductor-like Screening Model for Real Solvents (COSMO-RS). The combined results reveal that the hydrogen-bond basicity of ILs, and thus the IL anion, plays a major role through their wettability on both polar and non-polar surfaces. The increase of the IL hydrogen-bond accepting ability leads to an improved wettability of more polar surfaces (lower contact angles) while the opposite trend is observed on non-polar surfaces. The cation nature and alkyl side chain lengths have however a smaller impact on the wetting ability of ILs. Linear correlations were found between the experimental contact angles and the cation–anion hydrogen-bonding and cation ring energies, estimated using COSMO-RS, suggesting that these features primarily control the wetting ability of ILs. Furthermore, two-descriptor correlations are proposed here to predict the contact angles of a wide variety of ILs on glass, Al-plate, and PTFE surfaces. A new extended list is provided for the contact angles of ILs on three surfaces, which can be used as a priori information to choose appropriate ILs before a given application.",,"['Materials science', 'Physics']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False

In 2008, the Institute of Medicine began to review, evaluate, and summarize the literature on health outcomes in Gulf War-deployed and found sufficient evidence of a causal relationship with PTSD and suggestive evidence of an association with fibromyalgia (FM). This study examines the prevalence and impact of FM in women veterans and to explore the association between other comorbidities to improve risk differentiation for treatment and improve outcomes.
METHODS: This study is designed as a nested, cross-sectional study within a larger project funded by the U.S. Army at the University of South Florida, College of Nursing entitled ""Nursing Health Initiative for Empowering Women Veterans."" A sample of 76 participants completed a battery of study instruments related to physical and psychological stressors.
FINDINGS: Over half of the sample had a positive FM screening score (56.68%) although only 14.42% were deployed to the Middle East. More than 70% of participants reported harassment in life in the military and 32.9% reported sexual assault while in the military. Results of the 1-way analysis of variances find that there was a significant association of FM with the psychological symptoms of stress, depression, and PTSD. There was a significant association of FM with quality of life and sleep difficulty.
DISCUSSION, IMPACT, AND RECOMMENDATIONS: The results from this pilot study suggest there is a significant relationship between FM and the psychological symptoms of depression and PTSD. Nearly two-thirds of these women screened positive for depressive symptoms and just over one-quarter of participants had symptoms indicative of PTSD. Only a small proportion of women veterans in this study were deployed (14.42%) and this suggests that a trigger or risk factor other than deployment or combat may contribute to the development of FM and mental health symptomology. To focus on the complex interrelationships between pain, fatigue, sleep, and depression, a follow-up study with a larger sample powered for more complex statistical analyses is warranted. Additional analyses in this study reveal that over half of women veterans who reported military sexual trauma (MST) while in the military, screened positive for FM. Although our analyses did not reveal there to be a significant effect between FM and MST, it should be considered as a potential risk factor for FM as MST can be a precursor for PTSD. Women veterans who present with FM should be screened for MST as sexual trauma may not be disclosed. Understanding how many women veterans are affected with FM and the relationship with PTSD, MST, stress, depression, and sleep can improve screening and treatment to improve quality of life. This will also inform decision-making about how best to design and implement interventions, programs, and policies.",,['Medicine'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False
carticle_0017248251,Chapter 45 Structure and Mechanism of the Insulin Receptor Tyrosine Kinase,"Publisher Summary This chapter sheds light on the structure and mechanism of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). The actions of insulin hormone are mediated by the insulin receptor, a member of the RTK family of cell surface receptors. A key mechanism by which the insulin receptor and other tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases regulate catalytic activity is through reversible positioning of their activation loops. The activation loop of the insulin receptor, with three autophosphorylation sites (Tyr1158, Tyr1162, and Tyr1163), begins with the protein kinase-conserved 1150DFG motif and ends with tyrosine kinase-conserved Pro1172. Phosphotyrosine recruitment sites in RTKs usually reside in polypeptide segments that are N-terminal to the kinase domain (juxtamembrane region), or C-terminal to the kinase domain, or in the kinase insert region. These polypeptide segments are typically unstructured and can easily adopt an extended conformation, which is required for phosphorylation, and, upon phosphorylation, for binding to Src homology-2 (SH2) domains and phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains. The insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins are a family of four to six adaptor molecules that possess N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) and PTB domains, followed by more than 900 residues containing multiple sites of tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation. A crystal structure of protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTP1B, with a phosphorylated peptide representing the insulin-receptor kinase (IRK) domain activation loop reveals that a phosphotyrosine (pTyr1163) following the substrate phosphotyrosine (pTyr1162) is a specificity determinant. Because several other RTKs, which do not appear to be targets of PTP1B in vivo, contain tandem phosphotyrosines in their activation loops, other specificity determinants must exist.",,"['Biology', 'Medicine']",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False

However,floater particles have selectivity to permeability ratio.

The largest height (>18 m) and diameter (>21 cm) values recorded after 104 months were mostly from the clonal seed orchard families, while the lower performances were mainly observed for the native provenances. Narrow sense heritabilities, assessed for the clonal seed orchard families only, increased gradually with age, reaching relatively high values, especially for height at 104 months (h2 = 0.76). There were also some highly significant differences between the 41 genetic origins for six qualitative traits observed from 25 to 104 months. Overall, the clonal seed orchard families were marginally less crooked and grew more vertically than the other sources.• ConclusionsThese findings provide further evidence of the usefulness of a clonal seed orchard phase in the genetic improvement of teak and the beneficial influence of a wet tropical climate on major economic traits.",,['Biology'],False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

carticle_0022840953,Introducing Jus ante Bellum as a cosmopolitan approach to humanitarian intervention,"Cosmopolitans often argue that the international community has a humanitarian responsibility to intervene militarily in order to protect vulnerable individuals from violent threats and to pursue the establishment of a condition of cosmopolitan justice based on the notion of a 'global rule of law'. The purpose of this article is to argue that many of these cosmopolitan claims are incomplete and untenable on cosmopolitan grounds because they ignore the systemic and chronic structural factors that underwrite the root causes of these humanitarian threats. By way of examining cosmopolitan arguments for humanitarian military intervention and how systemic problems are further ignored in iterations of the Responsibility to Protect, this article suggests that many contemporary cosmopolitan arguments are guilty of focusing too narrowly on justifying a responsibility to respond to the symptoms of crisis versus demanding a similarly robust justification for a responsibility to alleviate persistent structural causes. Although this article recognizes that immediate principles of humanitarian intervention will, at times, be necessary, the article seeks to draw attention to what we are calling principles of <i>Jus ante Bellum</i> (right before war) and to stress that current cosmopolitan arguments about humanitarian intervention will remain insufficient without the incorporation of robust principles of distributive global justice that can provide secure foundations for a more thoroughgoing cosmopolitan condition of public right.",,"['Political science', 'Philosophy']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False
carticle_0023056593,An array of highly flexible electrodes with a tailored configuration locked by gelatin during implantation-initial evaluation in cortex cerebri of awake rats,"Background: A major challenge in the field of neural interfaces is to overcome the problem of poor stability of neuronal recordings, which impedes long-term studies of individual neurons in the brain. Conceivably, unstable recordings reflect relative movements between electrode and tissue. To address this challenge, we have developed a new ultra-flexible electrode array and evaluated its performance in awake non-restrained animals.
Methods: An array of eight separated gold leads (4 X 10 mu m), individually flexible in 3D, were cut from a gold sheet using laser milling and insulated with Parylene C. To provide structural support during implantation into rat cortex, the electrode array was embedded in a hard gelatin based material, which dissolves after implantation. Recordings were made during 3 weeks. At termination, the animals were perfused with fixative and frozen to prevent dislocation of the implanted electrodes. A thick slice of brain tissue, with the electrode array still in situ, was made transparent using methyl salicylate to evaluate the conformation of the implanted electrode array.
Results: Median noise levels and signal/noise remained relatively stable during the 3 week observation period; 4.3-5.911 mu V and 2.8-4.2, respectively. The spike amplitudes were often quite stable within recording sessions and for 15% of recordings where single-units were identified, the highest-SNR unit had an amplitude higher than 150 IN In addition, high correlations (>0.96) between unit waveforms recorded at different time points were obtained for 58% of the electrode sites. The structure of the electrode array was well preserved 3 weeks after implantation.
Conclusions: A new implantable multichannel neural interface, comprising electrodes individually flexible in 3D that retain its architecture and functionality after implantation has been developed. Since the new neural interface design is adaptable, it offers a versatile tool to explore the function of various brain structures.",,['Biology'],False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Its primary protoalkaloid is p-synephrine. Most studies involving bitter orange extract and p-synephrine have used products with multiple ingredients. The current study assessed the thermogenic effects of p-synephrine alone and in conjunction with the flavonoids naringin and hesperidin in a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled protocol with 10 subjects per treatment group. Resting metabolic rates (RMR), blood pressure, heart rates and a self-reported rating scale were determined at baseline and 75 min after oral ingestion of the test products in V-8 juice. A decrease of 30 kcal occurred in the placebo control relative to baseline. The group receiving p-synephrine (50 mg) alone exhibited a 65 kcal increase in RMR as compared to the placebo group. The consumption of 600 mg naringin with 50 mg p-synephrine resulted in a 129 kcal increase in RMR relative to the placebo group. In the group receiving 100 mg hesperidin in addition to the 50 mg p-synephrine plus 600 mg naringin, the RMR increased by 183 kcal, an increase that was statistically significant with respect to the placebo control (p<0.02). However, consuming 1000 mg hesperidin with 50 mg p-synephrine plus 600 mg naringin resulted in a RMR that was only 79 kcal greater than the placebo group. None of the treatment groups exhibited changes in heart rate or blood pressure relative to the control group, nor there were no differences in self-reported ratings of 10 symptoms between the treatment groups and the control group. This unusual finding of a thermogenic combination of ingredients that elevated metabolic rates without corresponding elevations in blood pressure and heart-rates warrants longer term studies to assess its value as a weight control agent.",,"['Biology', 'Medicine']",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False

Annual HIV incidence was calculated using HIV diagnoses within 1 year of negative NAAT, determined by matching with the citywide HIV registry. Predictors (demographic; behavioral; bacterial STD from citywide STD registry match) of all new HIV diagnoses through 2012 were calculated from Cox proportional hazards models. Among 10,487 HIV NAAT-negative MSM, 371 had an HIV diagnosis within 1 year. Annual incidence was 2.4/100 person-years, and highest among non-Hispanic black MSM (4.1/100 person-years) and MSM aged <20 years (5.7/100 person-years). Characteristics associated with all 648 new HIV diagnoses included: black race (aHR 2.2; 95 % CI 1.6–3.1), condomless receptive anal sex (aHR 2.1; 95 % CI 1.5–2.8), condomless insertive anal sex (aHR 1.3; 95 % CI 1.1–1.8), and incident STD diagnosis (aHR 1.6; 95 % CI 1.3–1.9).

carticle_0023828693,Human capital and the dynamic effects of trade,"This paper examines the cross-country income and welfare consequences of trade-induced human capital (dis-)accumulation. The model is based on heterogeneous workers who make educational decisions in the presence of complete markets. When such heterogeneous workers invest in schooling, high type agents earn a surplus from their investment. In the presence of cross-country differences in skill-augmenting technology, trade shifts this surplus to rich countries that can use skills more efficiently. Thus, while the static gains from trade may lead to convergence, the dynamic gains from trade occur to initially rich countries, thus leading to cross-country divergence of income and welfare. The second part of the paper endogenizes world prices, documenting that as trade liberalization concentrates skills in countries with a high level of skill-augmenting technology, it thereby increases the effective global supply of skilled labor. Despite the resulting decline in the price of skill-intensive goods, trade is shown to be skill biased. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

carticle_0027165244,Message Distortion in Information Cascades,"Information diffusion is usually modeled as a process in which immutable pieces of information propagate over a network. In reality, however, messages are not immutable, but may be morphed with every step, potentially entailing large cumulative distortions. This process may lead to misinformation even in the absence of malevolent actors, and understanding it is crucial for modeling and improving online information systems. Here, we perform a controlled, crowdsourced experiment in which we simulate the propagation of information from medical research papers. Starting from the original abstracts, crowd workers iteratively shorten previously produced summaries to increasingly smaller lengths. We also collect control summaries where the original abstract is compressed directly to the final target length. Comparing cascades to controls allows us to separate the effect of the length constraint from that of accumulated distortion. Via careful manual coding, we annotate lexical and semantic units in the medical abstracts and track them along cascades. We find that iterative summarization has a negative impact due to the accumulation of error, but that high-quality intermediate summaries result in less distorted messages than in the control case. Different types of information behave differently; in particular, the conclusion of a medical abstract (i.e., its key message) is distorted most. Finally, we compare extractive with abstractive summaries, finding that the latter are less prone to semantic distortion. Overall, this work is a first step in studying information cascades without the assumption that disseminated content is immutable, with implications on our understanding of the role of word-of-mouth effects on the misreporting of science.",Media lab,['Computer science'],False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

To assess the prevalence and risk factors of QTc prolongation in patients with HIV infection and further address the clinical significance. Methods The electrocardiograms (EKG) of 108 consecutive HIV-infected adults (>18 years) from January to December 2012 were reviewed. Data were analysed by the use of gender-specific QTc categories (men abnormal at > 440 ms and women abnormal at >460 ms) based on previous publication. Multiple variables of socio-demographic characteristics, laboratory findings and treatment were collected. Framingham score was calculated to assess 10-year cardiovascular risk, and D:A:D score based on traditional cardiovascular risk factors as well as HIV-specific factors was calculated to assess 5-year cardiovascular risk. Results The QTc interval was found to be prolonged in 25% HIV-infected patients. The mean ( ± SD) QTc was 474 ± 34ms in QTc prolongation group (range 442-551 ms in men and 473-486 in women), whereas 418 ± 23ms in normal QTc group (range 411-439 ms in men and 413-459 ms in women). The HIV-infected patients with prolonged QTc interval have higher D:A:D score (4.3 ± 4.7 vs 2.0 ± 2.9) and Framingham score (12.3 ± 13.4 vs 6.0 ± 7.3) than those with normal QTc interval. However, there were no clinical or latoratory parameters related to HIV independently associated with QTc interval prolongation. In particular, no anti-HIV drug was associated with QTc prolongation. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that in an HIV-infected population, QTc prolongation had a high prevalence of 25% compared to the general population.

Differentiating stroke from other causes is challenging for physicians. The role of biomarkers has been poorly assessed. We evaluated whether copeptin and S100b protein (PS100b) assessment, alone or in combination, could rule out stroke in patients visiting EDs for dizziness.
METHODS: We included patients 18 years of age or older, visiting the adult ED of a French university hospital for a new episode of dizziness evolving for less than 72 h. All patients underwent standardized physical examination (HINT [Head Impulse test, Nystagmus, test of skew deviation] maneuvers), copeptin and S-100b protein (PS100) measurement and injected brain imaging. Stroke diagnosis involved diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging or, if not available, neurological examination and contrast brain CT scan compatible with the diagnosis.
RESULTS: Of the 135 patients participating in the study, 13 (10%) had stroke. The sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of copeptin/PS100 combination were 100% (95%CI, 77-100%), 48% (40-57%), 14% (11-27%) and 100% (94-100%), respectively. Values for copeptin alone were 77% (CI95% 0.50-0.91), 50% (CI95% 0.49-0.58), 14% (CI95% 0.08-0.24), 93% (CI95% 0.87-0.98), and for PS100 alone were 54% (CI95% 0.29-0.77), 97% (CI95% 0.92-0.99), 64% (CI95% 0.35-0.84), 95% (CI95% 0.90-0.98).

This study was aimed at determining whether CD44 and p53 may serve as indicators of malignant progression of neurofibroma. CD44, a transmembrane glycoprotein receptor for hyaluronic acid, and participates in cell-extracellular matrix interactions and migration. CD44 may play a vital role, either through under or overexpression, with invasion and metastases of tumors, altering their ability to infiltrate the adjacent tissue. The tumor suppressor gene, p53, has also been implicated in malignant progression of various human tumors including malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). A total of 44 tumors from 33 patients with NF1 were evaluated with an anti-human CD44H, CD44 splice variant v6 and anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies. Morphologic expression patterns of expression were evaluated for CD44 while semiquantitative criteria were applied to assess, p53 nuclear positivity. Immunoexpression of p53 was markedly higher in 12 of 16 MPNST (75%). Thirteen of 28 (46%) benign neurofibroma also had some expression of p53 above &apos;normal level&apos;, although much lower than the MPNST. Plexiform neurofibroma did not differ from other benign lesions in their expression of p53. Our results suggest that p53 mutation as evidenced by immunohistochemical overexpression is a factor in malignant transformation and progression of neurofibroma. 70% of benign neurofibroma demonstrated some, usually focal, CD44 positivity. The pattern of CD44 expression in plexiform neurofibroma was revealing, as it was maximal in the &apos;nonencapsulated&apos; portions of the tumors. Eight of 11 (72%) locally infiltrative cutaneous neurofibroma and 13 of 16 (81%) MPNST exhibited diffuse CD44 positivity. CD44v6 expression was positive in control tissues but was not identified in any of tumor samples. Also, within the confines of encapsulated tumors CD44 expression is limited, while in poorly circumscribed neurofibroma CD44 expression is upregulated. This is interpreted as a reflection of the interaction of CD44+ tumor cells with extracellular matrix, hence facilitating infiltrative behavior.",,"['Biology', 'Medicine']",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False

Women were classified as having HTN if they were newly diagnosed with HTN from 2005 through 2012. <b><i>Results:</i></b> After 8 years of follow-up, 7.7% (148/1910) of pre-eclamptic women developed HTN. Using the Cox proportional hazards model, old age (hazard ratio [HR] 3.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.47-6.23), a family history of HTN (HR 2.28, 95% CI 1.46-3.58), prepregnancy obesity (HR 3.74, 95% CI 2.50-5.59), and high blood pressure (BP) (HR 2.78, 95% CI 1.85-4.19) were independently associated with the development of HTN. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> The results show that the development of HTN in pre-eclamptic women is related to prepregnancy factors. Recognizing who subsequently develops HTN postpartum in pre-eclamptic women with these prepregnancy factors could lead to early identification and lifestyle interventions, which could reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease.",,['Medicine'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False

We reviewed the medical records of four adult patients with symptomatic unilateral duplicated collecting systems and nonfunctioning upper pole renal units (NFUPRU) who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic heminephrectomy at our institutions. Heminephrectomy for NFUPRU should be approached differently than partial nephrectomy, because of complex vascular anatomy.

This preliminary study introduces a new type of Three- Dimensional (3D) cytological imaging, Optical Projection Tomographic Microscopy (OPTM) that has the potential to reduce errors in FNAB analysis. We first demonstrate the functionality of OPTM, a microscopic imaging method that produces high resolution 3D images of single cell specimens in absorption mode, to perform multi-cellular imaging of cells stained with hematoxylin. Then, we use OPTM to image entire FNAB-like specimens in their three-dimensional form without experiencing errors from overlapping cells, choice of focal plane, and sampling. Our methods show success in generating volumetric data of large density of cells inside a cylindrical tube representative of FNA specimen within a 23-gauge needle.

carticle_0035436235,The Cell Junction Protein Afadin Negatively Regulates Insulin Action and Modulates Adipose Tissue Function,"Adipose tissue dysfunction is one of the main culprits triggering metabolic imbalance associated with obesity. We identified the cell junction protein Afadin as one of the most highly phosphorylated proteins in response to insulin/IGF-1 stimulation using quantitative phospho-proteomic analysis in pre-adipocytes, and investigated the role of Afadin in mediating insulin action and in adipocyte biology. We found that phosphorylation of Afadin occurred in response to insulin in both pre- and mature adipocytes obtained from mice and human subjects. In addition, Afadin phosphorylation was observed in mouse adipose tissues following insulin injection, and after re-feeding, indicating physiological relevance. In obese mice, however, brown fat insulin-induced phosphorylation of Afadin was abolished. Surprisingly, glucose and insulin tolerance were improved in Fat-specific Afadin knock-out (KO) mice on a high fat diet, despite similar body weight gain and adipose mass as wild type controls. Furthermore, ablation of Afadin in vitro did not affect adipogenesis. Yet, prolonged insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt was observed in KO adipocytes, and was associated with increased insulin-mediated fatty-acid uptake. Finally, phosphorylation of Afadin regulates the docking of several proteins, which may be involved in the regulation of insulin action and adipocyte metabolism. Thus, Afadin is a novel bona fide substrate of the insulin signaling pathway, and is involved in the regulation of insulin action and metabolism.  Disclosure M. Lundh: None. M.S. Isidor: None. K.

For comparison of vaccinated immunity was determined by traditional methods of evaluation of the immune response.

Linking Large Corporate Ownership to Firms’ Use of Commitment Human Resource Practices,"Human resource practitioners and academics have increasingly realized the importance of corporate governance for firm human resource activities. This study investigates how one important form of corporate governance, namely, ownership within large, publicly traded firms, is associated with a firm's use of commitment human resource practices (CHRPs), specifically, the use of incentive compensation, profit sharing, and participative decision making. Our findings indicate that the types of large investor, namely, family and institutional, are differentially associated with the likelihood of the firm using these CHRPs. Specifically, family owners with their long-term investment horizon, as well as their stakeholder orientation, increase the likelihood of the firm using these practices. In contrast, large institutional owners with their shorter-term investment horizon, as well as their investor orientation, decrease the likelihood of the firm using these practices. Furthermore, among institutional investors, transient institutional investors are negatively associated with these practices, while dedicated institutional investors are not associated with these practices. Taken together, our results regarding the positive association of family ownership and this subset of CHRPs and the negative association of transient institutional investors and this set of practices, have important implications for human resource professionals who not only need to understand how ownership affects HR practices but also how to articulate the value of these investments in order to attract investors.

carticle_0037481913,Use of a novel multi-purpose sponge for laparoscopic surgery: Does it have special relevance to robotically-assisted laparoscopic surgery?,"BACKGROUND: The STAR System (Ekymed SpA) is a novel multipurpose sponge developed for conventional manual laparoscopic surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between December 2012 and December 2014, we successfully used the sponge in ten robot-assisted and ten direct manual laparoscopic operations to achieve haemostasis, for blunt dissections, for atraumatic lifting of solid organs, to check for bile leaks, for cleaning the surgical field thus avoiding frequent use of suction or the application of haemostatic agents. The reason of the insertion (RI), the main use (MU) and any further use (FU), once inserted, were registered for each operation and compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: The principal RI was haemostasis for minor bleeding, without differences between the two groups (P = not significant). Regard to MU, in the robotic group cleaning the surgical field was utilised more than laparoscopic group (100% vs. 60%; P = 0.03). About FU, atraumatic solid organs lifting was more frequent during robotically assisted surgery than with laparoscopy (50% vs. 0%; P = 0.01). A statistically more frequent use of the sponge was registered during standard laparoscopy for the blunt dissection (30% vs. 80%; P = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: The STAR System was beneficial in both approaches, but it imparts added benefit during robotically-assisted laparoscopic surgery organs because of the lack of tactile feedback and because the operating surgeon is remote from the patient, and has to rely on the assisting surgeon in the sterile field for dealing with bleeding episodes, cleansing/mopping the operative field when necessary, who may not be experienced or completely proficient.",,"['Engineering', 'Medicine']",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False

The displacements of the measured points on the rocket are obtained by the integration of the low-frequency vibration accelerations during free flight test. In the method, the data are filtered through wavelet transform. For comparison, several methods are used to extract the modal frequencies of the investigated beam.

  NonTrivial Strategic Form Games","We introduce a new solution concept for selecting optimal strategies in strategic form games which we call periodic strategies and the solution concept periodicity. As we will explicitly demonstrate, the periodicity solution concept has implications for non-trivial realistic games, which renders this solution concept very valuable. The most striking application of periodicity is that in mixed strategy strategic form games, we were able to find solutions that result to values for the utility function of each player, that are equal to the Nash equilibrium ones, with the difference that in the Nash strategies playing, the payoffs strongly depend on what the opponent plays, while in the periodic strategies case, the payoffs of each player are completely robust against what the opponent plays. We formally define and study periodic strategies in two player perfect information strategic form games, with pure strategies and generalize the results to include multiplayer games with perfect information. We prove that every non-trivial finite game has at least one periodic strategy, with non-trivial meaning a game with non-degenerate payoffs. In principle the algorithm we provide, holds true for every non-trivial game, because in degenerate games, inconsistencies can occur. In addition, we also address the incomplete information games in the context of Bayesian games, in which case generalizations of Bernheim’s rationalizability offers us the possibility to embed the periodicity concept in the Bayesian games framework. Applying the algorithm of periodic strategies in the case where mixed strategies are used, we find some very interesting outcomes with useful quantitative features for some classes of games. Particularly interesting are the implications of the algorithm to collective action games, for which we were able to establish the result that the collective action strategy can be incorporated in a purely non-cooperative context. Moreover, we address the periodicity issue for the case the players have a continuum set of strategies available. We also discuss whether periodic strategies can imply any sort of cooperativity and as we shall exemplify in detail, the periodicity solution concept is a purely non-cooperative thinking concept.

We now know that tumors are highly active both in their metabolism of available nutrients and in the secretion of metabolic by-products. However, cancer cells can modulate metabolic pathways and thus adapt to specific nutrients. Unlike tumor cells, immune cells are not subject to a 'micro-evolution' that would allow them to adapt to progressing tumors that continuously develop new mechanisms of immune escape. Consequently, immune cells are often irreversibly affected and may allow or even support cancer progression. The mechanisms of how tumors change immune cell function are not sufficiently explored. It is, however, clear that commonly shared features of tumor metabolism, such as local nutrient depletion or production of metabolic 'waste' can broadly affect immune cells and contribute to immune evasion. Moreover, immune cells utilize different metabolic programs based on their subtype and function, and these immunometabolic pathways can be modified in the tumor microenvironment.

These subsystems may be formed in a linear, planar or spatial array. A typical example of these formations is a chain of vehicles known as platoon formation in traffic flow. Platoon formation of vehicles is a linear or planar formation of vehicles where a certain and a constant headway, and sideway if applicable, is provided in between every and each one of them. It is argued in this paper that a well-automated platoon formation of vehicles is an extreme case of conformity. During this transformation from a many degrees of freedom formation to a solid object, Tsallis q value is computed to be ranging from one extreme case of q = 3 to the other where q = 1, when classified in terms of inverse temperatures of clearance fluctuations. At one-extreme of q = 3, one observes unbounded fluctuations in clearance fluctuations so that inverse temperature distributions approach a Dirac delta at the origin. At the other extreme of g = 1, fluctuations in clearance tend to zero asymptotically, where a solid structure of agents (vehicles) emerges. The transition from q = 3 to q = 1 is investigated through synthetic and experimental clearance fluctuations between the cars. The results show that during the transition from q = 3 to q = 1, the platoon loses its many degrees of freedom (dof) of motion until a solid single object emerges.

It has been widely used to treat geoscience data. The key decision of LSA is definition of window, including minimum and maximum window and increment of iterative window size. At present a common solution for choice of window is first to determine a maximum window size by trial and error using global considerations with the minimum window as 1 grid grid unit, and step size of the window side as 2 grids. In this paper, equal-area-growing concentric circles are used for calculating local singularities for mapping granites in Inner Mongolia. By the use of this method, all grids in one group are at the same distance from the current one being processed. This avoids exponential increase of the number of grids with increasing windows size; besides, inspired by the spatial Ustatistic for LSA, a simple integration method is used here to construct a multi-scale singularity map.",,"['Mathematics', 'Geology', 'Computer science']",False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the records of eligible patients with locoregionally confined, stage IB1 through IVA, intact cervical cancer who were treated at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. All patients underwent definitive radiotherapy with combined external beam radiation-the majority with extended-field (62%)-and received low-dose rate brachytherapy.
RESULTS: A total of 236 patients were included: 99 had no concurrent chemotherapy, 95 were treated with concurrent cisplatin, and 42 were treated with cisplatin/5-FU. For all patients treated with or without chemotherapy, overall survival at 5 and 10 years was 64% and 59%, respectively. Patients treated with chemotherapy had a superior recurrence-free survival rate of 69% at 5 years versus 49% in patients who did not receive chemotherapy (P=0.09). Twenty-six percent of patients treated with cisplatin alone, 31% of patients treated with cisplatin/5-FU, and 45% of patients who did not receive chemotherapy experienced a disease recurrence. Adenosquamous histology conferred a higher rate of recurrence as compared with adenocarcinoma and squamous cell histologies (54% vs. 34%, respectively; P=0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy showed a trend toward improved recurrence-free survival survival in the definitive treatment of nonmetastatic cervical cancer. The addition of 5-FU to cisplatin did not appear to significantly impact survival or recurrence-free survival. Adenosquamous histology was associated with a higher risk of recurrence as compared with other histologic subtypes.",,['Medicine'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False

In this study we use molecular data to elucidate the evolutionary history of Galerella nigrata and link its divergence to known major climatic events. A total of 51 samples from G. nigrata and 17 from Galerella sanguinea were used to provide the first molecular evidence that G. nigrata may be a species in its own right. Both mitochondrial cytochrome b and the nuclear ss-fibrinogen intron seven sequences of G. nigrata form distinct monophyletic clades, separate from its sister species G. sanguinea. We estimate the divergence of these two species to have occurred 3.85-4.27 million years ago, coinciding with a period of the Plio-Pleistocene that was characterised by cooling global temperatures and strong aridity in southern Africa. However, evidence for potential hybridization between the two species was documented for ten individuals using phenotypic (pelage colouration) and/or molecular (nuclear and mtDNA sequences and microsatellite loci) data. There appeared to be a bias towards unidirectional hybridization with all potential hybrids showing mtDNA haplotypes from G. nigrata. We suggest that as the desert expanded across Namibia, G. sanguinea likely retreated with the savanna, leaving some mongooses stranded on the granite inselbergs of north-western Namibia. Subsequent adaptation of these mongooses to local conditions on granite inselbergs could have led to ecological speciation. Secondary contact zones would have been re-established with subsequent global warming events. It appears that the two species have not yet undergone complete reproductive isolation.

carticle_0052530353,Limits of Technological Efficiency of Shale Oil Production in the USA,"The shale oil revolution in the United States had an irreversible impact upon the global oil market and was a key factor determining oil price reduction in 2014-2016. One of the main reasons for the rapid growth of the shale oil production in the US was the development of extracting technologies, which reduced the cost of production to an acceptable level. This article studies the problems of long-term forecasting in shale oil production and the productivity of drilling rigs. This research applies the fitting of an asymmetric bell-shaped function using an OLS approach. This function is derived as an analytical solution of the differential equation for oil production. Another innovation of this study is the asymmetric function, which correlates better with data on the extraction of traditional and non-traditional oil resources. An analysis of the empirical data with the derived asymmetrical bell-shaped curve shows that the productivity of drilling rigs will peak by 2026 at 1,200 bbl per day, which is 2 times higher than the current level. The peak of production would correspond to the maximum oil production of 11.3 mln bbl per day and to technically recoverable resources of 96 bln bbl. This could mean that starting from 2023, the volume of shale oil production in the US may not be enough to meet the growing global demand for oil and other resources with even higher production costs should be developed. The theoretically grounded and practically tested asymmetrical bell-shaped curve can serve as one of the tools for assessing the long-term impact of technological innovation and the growth of equipment productivity upon the development of oil production in the US in the course of Foresight studies.",Resource extraction / engineering??,"['Economics', 'Geology', 'Engineering']",False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

We utilized photolithography and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to pattern hydrophobic hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) islands and hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG)-Silane regions on 25 mm 25 mm glass slides. Compared with methods presently used, the photoresist wells can be more stable, and clear HMDS island arrays can be formed. We adopted a better and more powerful medium, the Biotin-(Strept)Avidin System to fix cells on the specified regions of the substrate. This is more efficient than the former medium, antibodies and antigens. Moreover, using a biotinylating cell surface, we produced more biotins on the surface of the cells and made it easier to capture cells and avoid washing away fixed cells. By changing the concentration of cell suspension for seeding, we found a suitable concentration (5 x 10(6) cells/ml), at which the cell occupation was greater than 90%. By comparing various diameters of streptavidin islands, optimal diameters (14-20 mu m) were found to capture single human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60). With all optimal parameters, single cell arrays were formed. The ratio of islands capturing only one cell was approximately 77%, which is better than similar approaches. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

carticle_0054779932,NMDA receptor modulation by the neuropeptide apelin: implications for excitotoxic injury.,"Excitotoxic neuronal damage via over-activation of the NMDA receptor has been implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases. In vitro modeling of excitotoxic injury has shown that activation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) counteracts such injury through modulation of neuronal pro-survival pathways and/or NMDA receptor signaling. We have previously demonstrated that the GPCR APJ and its endogenous neuropeptide ligand apelin can protect neurons against excitotoxicity, but the mechanism(s) of this neuroprotection remain incompletely understood. We hypothesized that apelin can promote neuronal survival by activating pro-survival signaling as well as inhibiting NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxic signaling cascades. Our results demonstrate that (i) apelin activates pro-survival signaling via inositol trisphosphate (IP(3) ), protein kinase C (PKC), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) to protect against excitotoxicity, and (ii) apelin inhibits excitotoxic signaling by attenuating NMDA receptor and calpain activity, and by modulating NMDA receptor subunit NR2B phosphorylation at serine 1480. These studies delineate a novel apelinergic signaling pathway that concurrently promotes survival and limits NMDA receptor-mediated injury to protect neurons against excitotoxicity. Defining apelin-mediated neuroprotection advances our understanding of neuroprotective pathways and will potentially improve our ability to develop therapeutics for excitotoxicity-associated neurodegenerative disorders.",,"['Biology', 'Medicine']",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False
carticle_0055204287,Characteristics and outcomes of injured patients presenting by private vehicle in a state trauma system.,"Background: Previous studies have demonstrated lower mortality among patients transported to single urban trauma centers by private vehicle (PV) compared with Emergency Medical Services (EMS). We sought to describe the characteristics and outcomes of injured patients transported by PV in a state trauma system compared to patients transported by EMS.
Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of state trauma registry data for patients admitted to all Pennsylvania trauma centers over 5 years (1/2003 to 12/2007). Our primary exposure of interest was prehospital mode of transport and our primary outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality. Unadjusted analyses were performed as were adjusted analyses controlling for injury severity. Data are presented as percents, odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals.
Results: Of the 91 132 patients analyzed, 9.6% were transported to the emergency department by PV and 90.4% by EMS. Overall Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 13.3 +/- 11.0 (ISS for EMS 13.7 +/- 11.3, PV 9.2 +/- 7.1, P < .001), and 6.6% of patients died (EMS 7.1%, PV 1.5%, P < .001). After adjusting for injury severity, patients transported by EMS were more likely to die than PV patients (OR 1.9 [95% CI 1.5-2.4]). This effect persisted in blunt, penetrating, advanced life support, and basic life support subgroups, but not in the severely injured (ISS > 15, ISS > 25) subgroups.
Conclusions: Nearly 10% of injured patients arrive at trauma centers by private vehicle. Transport of injured patients by EMS was associated with higher mortality than PV transport. This may reflect the effects of prehospital time, prehospital interventions, or other confounders. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

A Temporal Analysis of the Socio‐demographic Gradient in the Rising Adulthood Overweight Epidemic in China, 1989–2009","Using eight successive waves of the China Health and Nutrition Survey, this study applies hierarchical age-period-cohort models to investigate the rising prevalence rates of adulthood overweight in China. We find that overweight prevalence rates increase throughout adulthood until the early 50s. Period effects are very strong with a virtually monotonic increase from 1989 to 2009. Yet, as posited by the reversal hypothesis (a diminishing positive association between overweight prevalence and socioeconomic status alongside development), this increase is levelling off or absent in most recent survey waves for women, urban residents, and individuals with higher educational attainment. Most importantly, substantial period variations are explained by rapid urbanisation, and the period increases in overweight prevalence closely track the pace of urbanisation in China. Cohorts born in the beginning years of the Great Chinese Famine (1958-1961) have the highest overweight prevalence rates, whereas cohorts experiencing the Famine during the childhood ages of adiposity rebound (the next rise in body mass index after infancy, typically from age 5 to 7 years) are significantly less likely to be overweight.

Although nociceptive Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels have been studied extensively, the role of these channels expressed at the central terminals in the spinal cord is not fully understood. Here, we studied the expression and function of TRPV1 channels at the spinal cord following induction of inflammatory pain by Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) and neuropathic pain by Chronic Constriction Injury (CCI). Rats treated with CFA or subjected to CCI developed long-term thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity. Peripheral inflammation or injury induced an inflammatory response at the levels of spinal cord, which included activation of glia and increased levels of proinflammatory mediators. As a result, expression of TRPV1 was significantly increased and the associated function of TRPV1-mediated CGRP release was also significantly increased. Single intrathecal administration of resiniferatoxin (RTX), an ultrapotent TRPV1 agonist, selectively reversed inflammatory thermal hypersensitivity and the associated changes in TRPV1 expression and function without affecting mechanical hypersensitivity. In summary, peripheral nerve activity triggers an inflammatory response at the spinal dorsal horn, which results in enhanced expression and function of TRPV1 channels.

The appropriate blended films were selected to load lidocaine and used as drug delivery. It was found that dispersions of each gelatinized starch type provided different viscosities due to their amylose/amylopectin ratios. GRS dispersion could be blended with DNR latex up to 20 part per hundred of rubber (phr) because of its lowest viscosity. All gelatinized starch dispersions could be mixed with DNR latex to provide good film at the concentration of 5 phr. The percentage of moisture uptake and swelling ratio of these films increased causing the blending of gelatinized starch in DNR. The higher amounts of gelatinized starch increased the swelling ratio and volumetric swelling of blended film. The ultimate tensile strengths of these blended films were not different comparing to DNR film itself, but they had a tendency to raise up when the amounts of gelatinized starch increased. At 5 phr of gelatinized starch, GPS provided the highest percentage of elongation at break of blended film while GGS and GRS gave the lower values, respectively. Lidocaine could be mixed in DNR and 5 phr GRS blended films by simple mixing during film preparation process.

A new pair of amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal fragments of the luciferase was identified using semirational library screening, demonstrating achieved markedly higher sensitivity and signal-to-background ratio. The identified fragments were applied to the study of five G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) that interact with beta-arrestin on the plasma membrane. By generating cell lines stably expressing the GPCRs and beta-arrestin connected with the luciferase fragments, we demonstrated rapid and sensitive screening of potential chemicals that act on GPCRs using a 96-well microtiter plate format. The screening time was reduced to 5-10 min after ligand stimulation. The maximum response became more than 15-fold higher than the background signal. This luciferase complementation method also enabled accurate spatial and temporal analyses of interactions in single living cells using bioluminescence microscopy. These GPCR assays will facilitate developments of high-throughput screening systems in a multiwell plate format. Furthermore, using specific proteins of interest, the novel fragments of luciferase will provide different assay methods for the study of many intracellular signals in living cells and animals.",,['Biology'],False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Laser ablation profiles of strontium/calcium, barium/calcium and strontium isotope ratios in tooth enamel are a means to decipher intra-individual diet and habitat changes. Here we show that the home range area was of similar size for species of the three hominin genera but that the dietary breadth was much higher in Australopithecus africanus than in Paranthropus robustus and early Homo. We also confirm that P. robustus relied more on plant-based foodstuffs than early Homo.

carticle_0064187506,Combined puncture/cutting of elastomer membranes by pointed blades: An alternative approach of fracture energy,"Resistance to combined puncture and cutting is controlled by two energies, one is the fracture energy or the intrinsic strength of the material, the other reflects the friction energy between a pointed blade and the material. The purpose of this study is to propose an alternative approach derived from the fracture mechanics theory to calculate the fracture energy associated to the puncture/cutting of neoprene rubber by pointed blades. The proposed approach is also based on the application of a sample pre-strained during the puncture/cutting test in order to remove the contribution of friction. It was validated with two different pointed blade angles of 22.5 degrees and 35 degrees. Results show that for an applied pre-strain energy (or tearing energy) of high value, the friction between pointed blade and material is completely removed. Without friction, the total fracture energy is constant. In that case, the crack growth contribution of the applied pre-strain energy is marginal. Growth of the crack is thus completely caused by the puncture/cutting by a pointed blade. Finally, results suggest that the value of the fracture energy corresponding to puncture/cutting by pointed blades is obtained at a frictional contribution of zero, but not at tearing energy value of zero. The value obtained is three times higher than the cutting energy corresponding to a cut by razor blade and also larger than that obtained from puncture by medical needles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Occasionally, bone marrow (BM) samples are tested for chimerism and results are often similar. We investigated the significance of results that differ between PB and BM. Methods Retrospective review of post-allogeneic stem cell transplant patients, who were tested for chimerism on both PB and BM (total cells, unfractionated) within 7 days interval. The % recipient difference between PB and BM was compared with relapse/remission status (BM biopsy results, cytogenetics, molecular testing, CBC, and clinical follow-up documents. For patients with multiple time points of concurrent BM and PB results, only the first point was included in this evaluation. Results Concurrent BM and PB chimerism results were compared in 74 patients. Median age at transplant was 54 years (range: 3–76 years). Date of PB and BM sample post-transplant was median 207 days (range: 27–3102). Test methods were XY FISH (N = 9), short tandem repeat (N = 55) and quantitative PCR (N = 10). Diagnoses were myeloproliferative/dysplastic disease (N = 61), aplastic anemia (N = 2), lymphoma/lymphocytic leukemia (N = 11). % Recipient was higher in BM than PB (difference: Δ ⩾ 2 % ) in 11 patients, and similar ( Δ < 2 % ) in 63 patients. Of the 11 patients with Δ ⩾ 2 % , disease relapse was detected in 5 patients at BM collection and two more patients within the following 2 months (total N = 7/11). Of the 63 patients with Δ < 2 % , disease relapse was detected in 2 patients at BM collection and five more patients in the following 2 months (total N = 7/63). In the patients with Δ ⩾ 2 % compared to the patients with Δ < 2 % , relapse was higher at BM collection (p = 0.0005 by Fisher exact) and cumulatively in the following 2 months (p = 0.000004, chi-square). Mixed chimerism status (recipient ⩾5%) in PB was observed in 4/11 patients with Δ ⩾ 2 % and 9/63 patients with Δ < 2 % , not statistically different (p = 0.76). Mixed chimerism was associated with relapse in the patients with Δ < 2 % (p = 0.022, chi-square), but not in patients with Δ ⩾ 2 % (p = 0.55, Fisher exact).

It has been used to cure cardiovascular diseases, stress, anxiety, and nervous irritability. There has been no report on the pollen biology of this species. Therefore, this experiment was designed to investigate viability, in vitro germination, optimal storage temperature, and storage life of the pollen grains. Two colorimetric methods using either 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) or acetocarmine were employed. In a medium containing 5% sucrose, 100 ppm boric acid (H3BO3), and 1% agar, pollen germination rate was examined at five developmental stages including one day before anthesis, and 2 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after anthesis. Four storage temperatures, 4, 25, -20, and -80 degrees C, were applied to determine the optimum storage temperature and storage life of the pollens. Pollen germination was tested in a culture medium at 5-day intervals for 4 and 25 degrees C and every month for -20 and -80 degrees C. The highest pollen viability was observed by acetocarmine method. The viability of pollens before anthesis was 91.35% and reduced to 2.06% 72 h after anthesis.

carticle_0071722439,An Analysis Of The Risks Associated With Estate Duty In Retaining Control Over Trust Assets,"The use of trusts to minimise estate duty and other taxes has recently come under scrutiny from government. The DTC has proposed amendments to income tax legislation to serve as a deterrent against using trusts to avoid estate duty. Such amendments will, however, only discourage the use of trusts if the trust assets generate a significant amount of income and the donor of the assets or the beneficiaries of the trust have little or no other taxable income. The objective of this paper is to identify the estate duty risks associated with retaining control over trust assets. It was concluded that trust assets are only at risk of being included as deemed property in the estate of a deceased person where such person had, immediately prior to death, the legal competence to dispose of such property for the benefit of himself or his estate and that the conduct of the planner was not a relevant consideration in determining whether trust assets could be deemed property. However, the conduct of the estate planner with respect to trust assets could potentially lead to the inclusion of the property as actual property in his estate, particularly in circumstances where the trust was his alter ego and trust property was treated as his own, where the trust arrangement is regarded as simulated or where there was no intention to create a trust.",+Law?,['Business'],False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

carticle_0072712288,Interpretation of Indicator Studies of Multistage Fracturing,"Abstract The paper presents a technique for interpreting indicator studies of multi-stage hydraulic fracturing (MSHF) on horizontal wells (HW), based on numerical modeling of indicator transfer in the near-well zone. Two problems are distinguished in the simulation: the direct problem of calculating the pressure, water saturation, and concentration of the indicator at the given parameters of the well during the injection of the indicator and the further operation of the well; the inverse problem of selecting the parameters of the hydraulic fractures (geometry and permeability) from the measured curves of the indicator removal after the transfer of the well to the withdrawal. In the course of solving the inverse problem, the separation of the total water and oil rates along the fracturing intervals is determined. The direct problem is based on the mathematical model of a three-dimensional two-phase multicomponent filtration taking into account diffusion and sorption in the region of drainage of HW with MSHF. The case of water-soluble indicators is considered in the model. In the numerical implementation of this model, we use structured finite-volume grids with significant condensation near the fractures and wells, as well as fast-acting algorithms for the end-to-end solution of the problem for pressure in the reservoir and fractures and an explicit-implicit scheme for solving the tracer transfer problem. The solution of the inverse problem minimizes the deviation of the calculated tracer output curves, total production rate and water cut from the corresponding observation data. The minimization is performed iteratively (by modifying the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno method with the limitation of the memory used).The direct problem is solved at each iteration. In this case, a simplified model is used that takes into account the rectilinear-parallel structure of the filtration flow in the penetration region of the tracer, which makes it possible to expand the three-dimensional problem into a series of one-dimensional ones and substantially accelerate the calculation. The proposed algorithm for the interpretation of indicator studies is demonstrated by the example of processing real data obtained during the 4-interval transverse MSHF on a HW of a productive reservoir represented by the interlacing of sandy-siltstone rocks with dense interlayers of clays belonging to the terrigenous deposits of the Achimov strata of Western Siberia. The length of the horizontal section of the wellbore was 820 m. The water-soluble indicators DCT-WS-01, DCT-WS-03, DCT-WS-04, and DCT-WS-07 were used as tracers. The main hydraulic fracturing was preceded by mini-fracturing. The fractures contained 80 tons of ceramic proppant for the first three stages and 60 tons for the fourth stage. The average half-length of the hydraulic fractures was 100 m, height - 50 m, and thickness - 4 mm.",,"['Geology', 'Mathematics']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False

We identify the major causes of burden of disease in each country, as well as the contribution HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria make to the total burden of disease estimates. We then use budgetary allocation information to assess the alignment of funding with burden of disease data.

Spectral diffusion, which includes personalized page rank and label propagation, propagates through random walks. Social diffusion propagates through shortest paths. These diffusions are linear in the sense of not distinguishing between contributions of few ""strong"" relations or many ""weak'' relations. Recent methods such as node embeddings and graph convolutional networks (GCN) attained significant gains in quality for SSL tasks. These methods vary on how the graph structure, seed label information, and other features are used, but do share a common thread of nonlinearity that suppresses weak relations and re-enforces stronger ones. Aiming for quality gain with more scalable methods, we revisit classic linear diffusion methods and place them in a self-training framework. The resulting bootstrapped diffusions are nonlinear in that they re-enforce stronger relations, as with the more complex methods. Surprisingly, we observe that SSL with bootstrapped diffusions not only significantly improves over the respective non-bootstrapped baselines but also outperform state-of-the-art SSL methods.

  Distributed hash table (DHT) abstraction, heterogeneous nodes, and non
uniform distribution of objects are the reasons to cause load imbalance in
structured P2P overlay networks.
  Previous works solved the load balancing problem by assuming the homogeneous
capabilities of nodes, unawareness of the link latency during transferring
load, and imposing logical structures to collect and reassign load.
  We propose a distributed load balancing algorithm with the topology awareness
feature by using the concept of virtual servers.
  In our approach, each node collects neighborhood load information from
physically close nodes and reassigns virtual servers to overlay nodes based
upon the topology of underlying network.
  Consequently, our approach converges data load balancing quickly and it also
reduces the load transfer cost between nodes.
  Moreover, our approach increases the quality of load balancing among close
nodes of overlay and it also introduces a new tradeoff between the quality of
load balancing and load transfer cost among all overlay nodes.
  Our simulations show that our approach reduces the load transfer cost and it
saves network bandwidth respectively.
  Finally, we show that the in-degree imbalance of nodes, as a consequence of
topology awareness, cannot lead to a remarkable problem in topology aware
overlays.",,['Computer science'],False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False
carticle_0083821864,More inclusive and cleaner cities with waste management co-production: Insights from participatory epistemologies and methods,"With over half of the world's population living in cities, and with rising consumption, the generation of solid waste has become a ubiquitous and serious problem in urban agglomerations. City administrations are facing social, cultural, environmental, and economic challenges when planning solid waste solutions. The paper discusses the participatory epistemology and methodology experience resulting from inclusive solid waste management in Brazil. In the global South countless informal and organized solid waste collectors are engaged in resource recovery, classification of discarded waste, and redirection of recyclables towards the recycling sector. Their work is mostly unrecognized and the service is not remunerated. Governmental support to include recycling cooperatives in selective waste collection varies significantly in scope and quality. In theory, the Brazilian solid waste management legislation supports recycling cooperatives and promotes avoidance, reuse, and recycling as a primary solution tackling waste. In praxis, however, many challenges towards inclusive resource recovery and awareness building about waste avoidance and diversion are yet to be overcome. Action-oriented, participatory qualitative research, conducted with recycling cooperatives and local governments in the metropolitan region of Sao Paulo, has revealed some of the environmental and social contributions, as well as challenges arising in planning, policy design, and implementation of waste management. The research applies a feminist and post-colonial theoretical lense and demonstrates a wealth of knowledge co-generation on waste management. The participatory method underlines important social aspects to consider in planning and policy design for inclusive waste management. The final conclusion of this paper is that selective household waste collection with recycling cooperatives creates unique opportunities to build more inclusive and cleaner cities.

factor Xa inhibitor. The aim of the present study was to develop a stability
indicating HPLC method for the quantification of edoxaban in bulk and in tablet
dosage form. 
Methods: Edoxaban
was separated on Hypersil BDS C18 column (250 x 4.6 mm, i.d. 5µm) using 0.1M K2HPO4:
Methanol (65:35, v/v) as an isocratic
mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Detection was performed using
photodiode array detector set at 245 nm. The chromatographic conditions were
optimized. The method was validated as per the guidelines given by International Conference on Harmonization guidelines.
Results: Edoxaban was eluted at 3.785 min with a total run
time of 6 min. The calibration curve was found to be linear over the
concentration range of 5–200 μg/ml. Limit of detection and limit of
quantification for edoxaban are 0.209 µg/ml and 0.698 µg/ml, respectively. The
intra- and inter-day precision values were ≤0.710% and the accuracy ranged from
99.824-100.720%. Besides, all the validation results were within acceptability
criteria of general assay. The stability
indicating nature of the method was established by subjecting the edoxaban to
stress conditions such as acid and base hydrolyses, oxidative, photo- and thermal

Her doctor ordered her to be hospitalized and fed through a tube until she delivered. But the nutrition source container that was feeding her via a feeding tube in her stomach was mistakenly connected to an existing intravenous line. Tragically, both Rodgers and her unborn child died. That same year, a Wisconsin nurse mistakenly injected a spinal anesthetic into an IV tube, killing 16-year-old Jasmine Gant, who was giving birth. In another incident, premature infant Chloe Back was mistakenly connected to a bag of breast milk through her IV tube. In this case, the baby did not die, but formed blood clots throughout her body, bled profusely, and suffered seizures for months afterward. In response to these and the many other reports of tubing misconnections that have plagued healthcare workers and human factors engineers for decades, a Sentinel Alert was issued by the Joint Commission in 2006 to draw attention to the gravity of the matter. This year, articles in a number of publications, most prominently the New York Times and Las Vegas Review Journal, have again brought the issue to the forefront. These articles led to a Congressional committee inquiry and a call for new regulations by the Nevada Medical Association. They also prompted the medical device industry and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to publicize the work that has been underway for some time in the development of a new international standard that many hope will virtually eliminate future tubing misconnections. The first of a series of new standards is currently at final voting (FDIS) stage internationally, and will be issued after approval under the designation and title ISO 80369-1, Small-bore connectors for liquids and gases in healthcare applications. Other parts of the series will address connectors for specific applications. In the meantime, 80369-1 is expected to provide unprecedented methods to identify specific connector solutions for a variety of medical applications. Brad Noe, technical resources manager at Becton Dickinson and Company, is co-chair of the AAMI small bore connectors working group, which serves as the U.S. technical advisory sub-group (sub-TAG) for the ISO/IEC connector standards, and is also project leader for two of the ISO/TC 210 project groups developing the series. Noe says that human error due to device issues, environment of care, and other factors certainly plays a part in such misconnections, although “how much a part,” he says, “is difficult to quantify. The misconnection of tubing sets due to working in dimly lit conditions, inability to trace the line from connection point to connection point, or incorrect or missing labels all contribute,” he explains.

carticle_0087689442,Estimating the Choice of Entrepreneurship as a Career: The Case of Universiti Utara Malaysia,"ABSTRACTUsing of the case of Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM), this study aims to estimate the factors that influence the entrepreneurship career choice among UUM students and graduates, in particular, the effect of educational factor on the probability that a graduate will choose entrepreneurship as his or her career. Results of descriptive statistics reveal that the tendency of choosing entrepreneurship as career is high among the sample and it is associated with gender, ethnic groups, degree, CGPA and family entrepreneurship experiences. Nevertheless, the estimated Multinomial Logit model indicates that the significant factors are entrepreneur education, family entrepreneurship experiences and economic factor (proxy by intention to start a business upon graduation). The significant of educational factor implies that the educated entrepreneur can be cultivated and this empirical result supports the current policy of Malaysia government to grow the graduate entrepreneur through education. The findings of this paper suggest that entrepreneurship should be viewed as an important career choice among the university students and graduates. This career choice is seen as a choice that could improve the economy performance, particularly to the labor market because the entrepreneurship activity is able to create more jobs and prosperous.Keywords: Entrepreneurship; Career Choice; Multinomial Logit Model.(ProQuest: ... denotes formulae omitted.)1. INTRODUCTIONEmpowered with a combination of skills, motivation, ideas and opportunities, undergraduate students (or graduates) are expected to be more than able to establish productive and creative in entrepreneurial activities. Entrepreneurship will also able to change them from being ""job seeker"" to ""job creator"". Entrepreneurship is also crucial in changing people from being socially dependent to self-sufficient. Moreover, many self-employed graduates' also contribute to the upkeep of their families, sometimes playing the role of breadwinners.The concept and meaning of entrepreneurship is changing and becoming complex due the change in the economic environment and social interpretation. For instance, since the financial crisis of 1997 the graduate unemployment problem in Malaysia is increasing and persistent (Lim, Rich & Harris, 2008); and in this context, the career choice of entrepreneurship (i.e., being self-employed) is showing its significance in solving the graduate unemployment problem.According to the published employment statistics on 2011, the number of employment in Malaysia has increased. However, the number of unemployment also increased to 421,800 persons (January 2011) compared to 387,900 persons (January 2010). The unemployment rate is remaining unchanged at 3.4 percent in 2010 and January 2011 (Department of Statistics Malaysia, 2011). Relating to the employment status of graduates in Malaysia, the Tracer Study of year 2010 conducted by the Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia (MoHE) found that the employed graduates are 50.4 percent, furthering studies 16.6 percent, graduate who are in developing skills is about 1.4 percent, waiting for work placement about 7 percent and graduates who are unemployed are 24.6 percent (Table 1). In terms of number, there are 42, 944 unemployed graduates.In this context, involvement in the entrepreneurial activity could be one of the best strategies to overcome the graduate unemployment problem. In addition, it will increase the economic performance in this country. As suggested by Kupets (2006), unemployment among the fresh graduates is increasing in the current economic environment and to overcome the unemployment problem, universities are seen to be playing a leading role in the development of student entrepreneurs. For instance, introducing entrepreneurship courses to equip the students with the skills, values, and behavior to undertake business endeavours successfully in the future. …",Ed!,['Economics'],False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

This proposed model lays the foundation for specific assessment/intervention program development focused on altering the way special education students interact with different people and within different contexts, in order to promote resilient behaviors in the actors involved in their academic achievement and adaptation, and educational inclusion.

The concept of cough hypersensitivity has allowed an umbrella term that explains the exquisite sensitivity of patients to external stimuli such a cold air, perfumes, smoke and bleach. Thus, adults with chronic cough now have a firm physical explanation for their symptoms based on vagal afferent hypersensitivity. Different treatable traits exist with cough variant asthma (CVA)/eosinophilic bronchitis responding to anti-inflammatory treatment and non-acid reflux being treated with promotility agents rather the anti-acid drugs. An alternative antitussive strategy is to reduce hypersensitivity by neuromodulation. Low-dose morphine is highly effective in a subset of patients with cough resistant to other treatments. Gabapentin and pregabalin are also advocated, but in clinical experience they are limited by adverse events. Perhaps the most promising future developments in pharmacotherapy are drugs which tackle neuronal hypersensitivity by blocking excitability of afferent nerves by inhibiting targets such as the ATP receptor (P2X3). Finally, cough suppression therapy when performed by competent practitioners can be highly effective. Children are not small adults and a pursuit of an underlying cause for cough is advocated. Thus, in toddlers, inhalation of a foreign body is common. Persistent bacterial bronchitis is a common and previously unrecognised cause of wet cough in children.

Anisotropy in the chiral symmetry and the preferred alignment of galaxies is studied using chi-square, auto-correlation and the Fourier tests. We noticed a good agreement between the random alignment of the position angle (PA) distribution and the existence of chirality in both the leading and trailing modes. Chirality is found stronger for the late- type spirals (Sc, Scd, Sd and Sm) than that of the early types (Sa, Sab, Sb and Sbc).

The classification of psychological distress and illness behavior in the setting of medical disease is still controversial. Current psychiatric nosology does not seem to cover the spectrum of disturbances. The aim of this investigation was to assess whether the joint use of DSM-IV categories and the Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research (DCPR), that provide identification of syndromes related to somatization, abnormal illness behavior, irritable mood, type A behavior, demoralization and alexithymia, could yield subtyping of psychosocial variables in the medically ill.
Method. A cross-sectional assessment using both DSM-IV and the DCPR was conducted in eight medical centers in the Italian Health System. Data were submitted to cluster analysis. Participants were consecutive medical out-patients and in-patients for whom a psychiatric consultation was requested. A total of 1700 subjects met eligibility criteria and 1560 agreed to participate.
Results. Three clusters were identified : non-specific psychological distress, irritability and affective disturbances with somatization.
Conclusions. Two-step cluster analysis revealed clusters that were found to occur across clinical settings.

Burnhill, Doctor of Philosophy, 2012 Dissertation Directed by: Professor Ellen Fabian Department of Counseling and Personnel Services Few studies have examined the elements of disclosing a disability in the workplace. Those few studies had a primary focus on reasonable accommodations (RA) where the disclosure process was either secondary or tertiary to the study. Further, there have been no studies to date which have examined elements of disclosure for individuals with brain injury (BI). Disclosure of disability is a crucial first step in the request process for a reasonable accommodation in the workplace and is required by the ADA for individuals requesting job related accommodations. This study examined the (a) experiences of work-related disability disclosure for individuals with BI, (b) the injury, demographic and other factors associated with the decision to disclose a disability at work, and (c) employment-related outcomes associated with disclosure. The primary goal of the current study is to describe the population of people with brain injury who disclose their disability in the workplace and to make inferences about the contributing factors involved in the disclosure process. The study used a cross-sectional survey methods research design. The study consisted of 200 individuals recruited from an online survey hosted on the Brain Injury Association of America’s website. Of these participants, 144 (74.6%) disclosed their disability on at least one job and 91 (45%) were currently working. Level of education (X2 =11.945, 3, p=.008), self-efficacy score (F=7.52; p=.007) and time between injury and current age (F=4.56; p=.034) were significantly related to disclosure. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the combined effects of several predictor variables with disclosure. In this analysis, only time since injury and selfefficacy (SE) scores were significant, where higher SE scores increased the odds of disclosure, and time since injury decreases the odds of disclosure (the more recent the injury, the more likely the individual was to disclose).

Methods: Thirty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200 to 250 g, were randomized into three groups treated with (1) sham surgery, (2) normal saline (NS), and (3) brain extract (BE). The BE was taken from incubating chick embryos at day 8. The sciatic nerve was exposed and sharply transected at the mid thigh level. Immediate epineurial repair was then performed. The BE treated animals were given 400 µl/kg of the chick embryo BE intraperitoneal, once daily, for 2 weeks. All animals were evaluated by sciatic functional index (SFI), electrophysiology, histology, and immunohistochemistry at days 28, 90 after surgery.
Results: The mean SFI difference between BE and NS groups at days 28, 60 and 90 after surgery was statistically significant (<i>p</i>=0.086).

Here, we report a benchtop roll-to-roll technique that builds upon the use of binary solutions of nanomaterials and liquid electrophoretic assembly to rapidly construct hybrid materials for battery design applications. We demonstrate surfactant-free hybrid mixtures of carbon nanotubes, silicon nanoparticles, MoS2 nanosheets, carbon nanohorns, and graphene nanoplatelets. Roll-to-roll electrophoretic assembly from these solutions enables the controlled fabrication of homogeneous coatings of these nanostructures that maintain chemical and physical properties defined by the synergistic combination of nanomaterials utilized without adverse effects of surfactants or impurities that typically limit liquid nanomanufacturing routes. To demonstrate the utility of this nanomanufacturing approach, we employed roll-to-roll electrophoretic processing to fabricate both positive and negative electrodes for lithium ion batteries in less than 30 s. The optimized full-cell battery, containing active materials of prelithiated silicon nanoparticles and MoS2 nanosheets, was assessed to exhibit energy densities of 167 Wh/kgcell(-1) and power densities of 9.6 kW/kgcell(-1).",,['Materials science'],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

The digestate produced is a valuable source of plant nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. However, minimising ammonia (NH3) emissions following land application of digestate is important to maximise crop available N supply and reduce environmental impacts. The objectives of this study were (1) to compare NH3 emissions from food-based digestate to those from cattle slurry applied to grassland under comparable conditions and (2) to evaluate the effect of precision application techniques (shallow injection and trailing shoe) on NH3 emissions compared with the conventional surface broadcast method. The results showed that NH3 emissions from broadcast-applied food-based digestate (mean 31% total N applied) were higher than from cattle slurry (mean 21% total N applied), reflecting its higher total N and NH4-N contents, and high pH (mean pH 8.4). Both precision application methods reduced NH3 emissions from food-based digestate by 40-50% in comparison with the surface broadcast treatments, with shallow injection more effective than trailing shoe (P &lt; 0.05). Precision application techniques could be an effective method for reducing NH3 emissions when applying food-based digestate to grassland, providing soil conditions are suitable. Practitioners should be encouraged to use precision application techniques when spreading high N digestates.

carticle_0110796165,POTENTIAL OF MICROBIAL ANTAGONISTS AS BIOCONTROL AGENTS AGAINST PLANT FUNGAL PATHOGENS,"A variety of fungi are known to cause important plant diseases, resulting in a significant lost in agricultural crops. The plant diseases need to be controlled to maintain the level of yield both quantitatively and qualitatively. Farmers often rely heavily on the use of synthetic fungicides to control the plant diseases. However, the environmental problems caused by excessive use and misuse of synthetic fungicide have led to considerable changes in people’s attitudes towards the use of synthetic pesticides in agriculture. Today, there is an increase in the awareness of the people about the healthy food and healthy environment. In response to this need, some researchers have focused their effort to develop alternati ve measures to synthetic chemicals for controlling plant diseases. Among these, is that referred to as biological control using microbial antagonists. Many microbial antagonists have been reported to posses antagonistic activities against plant fungal pathogens, such as Pseudomonas fluorescens , Agrobacterium radiobacter , Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, B. amyloliquefaciens, Trichoderma virens, Burkholderia cepacia, Saccharomyces sp, Gliocadium sp. Three species of rhizobacteria isolated from rhizospheres of r ice grown in Bali, i.e. Enterobacter agglomerans, Seratia liquefaciens and Xanthomonas luminescens were found to effectively suppressed the growth of Pyricularia oryzae Cav. the cause of rice blast disease. Understanding the mechanism by which the biocontrol of plant diseases occurs is critical to the eventual improvement and wider use of biocontrol method. These mechanisms are generally classified as competition, parasitism, antibiosis, and induction of host resistance. Over the past forty years, research has lead to the development of a small commercial sector that produces a number of biocontrol products. The market share of biopesticides of the total pesticide market is less than three percent. However, significant expansion is expected over the next de cades due to the expanded demand for organic food, and increased demand for safer pesticides in agriculture and forestry . The challenge is to develop a formulation and application method that can be implemented on a commercial scale, that must be effective, reliable, consistent, economically feasible, and with a wider spectrum. Continual laboratory works followed by field experiments are needed to establish excellent biocontrol agents particularly against plant fungal pathogens.",,['Biology'],False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

                    Esophageal cancer tends to be malnourished due to anorexia, transit disorder, so it is important to conduct sufficient nutritional assessment and treatment. For standard treatment of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for esophageal cancer, Cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil (FP) therapy is common, but sufficient therapeutic effect has not been obtained. As a more powerful regimen, DCF therapy with Docetaxel added to FP therapy and chemoradiotherapy have been introduced. In this study, we examined pretreatment nutritional score of esophageal cancer patients who underwent neoadjuvant therapy.
                  
                  
                    Methods
                    We studied 105 patients undergoing preoperative treatment diagnosed as esophageal cancer or esophagogastric junctional carcinoma from July 2012 to August 2017. Esophagectomy with lymph node dissection after neoadjuvant therapy. Relationship between Glassgow Prognostic Score (GPS) and Controlling Nutrition Status Score (CONUT) score, sex, age, staging, main tumor location, adverse event, postoperative complication and tube feeding nutrition are examined.
                  
                  
                    Results
                    Median age was 66 years, male/female = 92/13, and cases requiring tube feeding were 29 cases. The breakdown of the clinical stage is Stage IA, B/IIA, B/IIIA, B, C/IV = 9/34/50/12. The breakdown of neoadjuvant therapy is FP/DCF/FPRT/DCFRT/other = 9/27/26/39/4. The incidences of grade 3/4 adverse events during preoperative treatment were 66 cases (63%) in 105 patients. The treatment effect is CR/PR/SD/PD = 6/41/50/8. Histopathological result is Grade 0/1a/1b/2/3 = 3/52/13/6/31. Postoperative complications were Clavien-Dindo classification Grade IIIa or more in 20 cases, in-hospital death was 1 case.CONUT score was judged to be cut-off by more than 2, there was a significant relationship between presence of tube nutrition and treatment result (P = 0.0376, 0.0231). GPS was judged to be 1 or more cutoff, there was a significant association with tube nutrition availability and histopathological result (P = 0.0019, 0.0083). There was no significant difference between occurrence of adverse events and occurrence of postoperative complications.
                  
                  
                    Conclusion
                    It was suggested that CONUTscore and GPS at hospitalization are useful as predictors of treatment result and histopathological result in esophageal cancer patients who undergo neoadjuvant therapy.

All 105 incoming fourth-year dental students in 2016 were invited to participate in the study, and 92 students completed the temperament questionnaire, for a response rate of 87.5%. Those students' clinical activity during their third year was measured by production points and percentage of broken appointments extracted from the electronic health record. The results showed that the majority of the respondents were extroverts rather than introverts and that the extroverts had significantly higher production points and significantly fewer broken appointments than the introverts. The most common personality preferences were sensing and judging. More than two-thirds of the respondents represented the Guardian temperament, one of four categories on the temperament measure. These findings help highlight the traits that may contribute to success in clinical training during dental school and support the notion that clinical success may be influenced by certain personality characteristics as well as the technical and specialized skills of dentistry.","Education, too","['Psychology', 'Medicine']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False

In the phloem tissues of affected plants stem necrosis takes place. In necrotic regions no sieve tubes were observed only necrotic cells and parenchyma cells. The sieve tubes present on the border of necrosis showed collapsed walls and were rich in vesicles. Phytoplasma cells were observed in sieve tubes present in nonnecrotic regions of the phloem. Various structural changes in sieve elements were investigated. The endoplasmic reticulum cistemae were often localised in the lumen of the sieve element without contact with the walls. Such localisation of endoplasmic reticulum was never observed in healthy plants. Vesicles of different size, fuzzy material and clumping of p-proteins were characteristic for sieve elements from nonnecrotic part of phloem. No correlation with the sieve tube structure and the appearance of phytoplasma in a single sieve element was found.

carticle_0120802921,Reshaping understandings of disability associated with age-related vision loss (ARVL): incorporating critical disability perspectives into research and practice.,"PURPOSE: In this paper, we have sought to stimulate a critical dialog regarding the ways in which disability has been largely conceptualized and studied in literature addressing age-related vision loss (ARVL). We suggest an expansion of this largely biomedically informed research area to include alternative frameworks, namely critical disability perspectives.
METHOD: To demonstrate the potential contributions of adopting a critical disability approach to enhance understandings of ARVL, this article outlined the primary tenets of the biomedical and social models of disability; the key aims, emphases, and assumptions of critical disability perspectives; and provided examples of how such an approach would lead to new research foci in the study of ARVL.
RESULTS: The paper highlighted four qualities of critical disability perspectives that future ARVL research should ascribe to, including (a) a focus on interdependence over traditional notions of independence; (b) a broader conceptualization of 'normalcy'; (c) the influence of language as a means of describing or labeling disabled persons; and (d) the influence of the socio-political environment in the creation and sustainment of disability.
CONCLUSIONS: This paper encouraged the incorporation of critical disability perspectives to provide new ways of conceptualizing, researching, writing about, and practicing in relation to ARVL. Implications for Rehabilitation The application of critical disability perspectives to expand the boundaries of low vision research can broaden low vision rehabilitation services (LVRS) in ways that more effectively attend to environmental features shaping and perpetuating disability for clients with age-related vision loss (ARVL). Low vision research, informed by critical disability perspectives, would inform a shift away from the exclusive focus on independence towards an acknowledgment of interdependence. The integration of participatory research approaches in ARVL research could generate new insights to inform rehabilitation by enhancing space and respect for the stories and knowledge of older adults aging with vision loss. Greater attention in low vision rehabilitation should be paid to how older adults' experiences of disability are tied to both the environmental context in which they exist and by the limitations caused by their impairment.",,"['Sociology', 'Medicine']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True

In all the experiments, sorption kinetics showed a biphasic pattern characterized by an initial, relatively short phase with a high sorption rate and a later phase with much a lower sorption rate. Initial sorption capacity increased with soil organic carbon content and with sorbate hydrophobicity. We postulate that the first phase of the process involves a fast second-order sorption reaction on superficial sites of soil particles, whereas the second phase depends on diffusion-controlled migration to internal binding sites. A kinetic equation based on this hybrid model accurately fitted all data sets. Less satisfactory results were obtained employing the pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order, Elovich, two site non-equilibrium, or Weber-Morris equation.

The interviewees represent academics with more than 10 years of experience in a leading role, or industry members with 10 or more years participating on an advisory board or similar capacity. The issues discussed include the following: consistent characteristics of the academics and programs, which lead to creation of a sustainable model; methods of integrating industry involvement; appropriate research topics; and the opportunities and obstacles of starting an industry research program. The results suggest that successful programs are not built around extremely specific research topics, but have the ability to continue to draw participation with new research questions at the appropriate stages. The engagement of industry should be early in the process to allow industry opportunity to shape the research problem and direction. However, even the industry members noted that the problems should not be immediate issues, but the underlying problems that will improve practice in the long-term.

Its economy grew at an average annual rate of 4.9 percent between 2000 and 2008. Then came the financial crisis and growth dipped to 2 percent. Since 2009, the International Monetary Fund estimates growth has averaged 5.4 percent. Between 2001 and 2010, six out of the ten fastest growing economies were in Africa. This trend, the Fund predicts, will continue. What was the impact of growth on the lives of ordinary Africans? ""After steadily increasing from 51 percent in 1981 to 58 percent in 1999,"" the World Bank has recently found, ""The extreme poverty rate fell 10 percentage points in ... [sub-Saharan Africa] between 1999 and 2010 and is now at 48 percent--an impressive 17 percent decline in one decade."" That reduction in poverty is especially encouraging considering that the population of Africa rose from 375 million in 1980 to 823 million in 2010. Contrary to some commentators, Africa's fortunes improved less because of high commodity prices and more because of the slow but steady spread of capitalism. Resources accounted for only about a third of Africa's newfound growth, according to the McKinsey report ""What's Driving Africa's Growth?"" Internal structural changes accounted for the rest, including reduction of inflation, foreign debt, budget deficits, taxes, and trade barriers, and improvements of the business and legal environments. Africa's Third Liberation: the New Search for Prosperity and Jobs is a much-needed and unapologetic call for further structural reforms in sub-Saharan Africa. As Greg Mills and Jeffrey Herbst acknowledge, the environment for African economic development has been slowly improving. For example, both political freedom as measured by the Freedom House and economic freedom as measured by the Fraser Institute rose since the end of the Cold War. Overall, however, African political and economic elites lack a comprehensive commitment to development. As the authors write, ""If Africa's first liberation was from colonial and racist government, and the second from its liberators, the third is the change in focus of politics itself. Concentrating on economic development to the exclusion of much else is required."" Too often, African elites ""revert to populism, patronage and economic nationalism rather than venturing reforms that will expand the economy."" Faced with the haphazard nature of African reforms, the authors traversed the developing world--from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica in Central America, to Dubai and Abu Dhabi in the Middle East, and Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, and Bangladesh in Asia--in search of lessons applicable to Africa.

Empirical studies in online deliberation suggest that online forums often produce fragmented and unorganized public preferences when conversations occur naturally without facilitation. However, it remains unknown as to what degree an unfacilitated online forum can achieve desired quality. Here we report a detailed content analysis on local newspaper forums to reveal the patterns of progression towards the formation of public preferences in a local planning context.

Implementation of power electronics, include the use of static converters in very broad functions such as power supply, control of electric machines and others. But in some applications are only available resources with a high voltage rating that required a converter to switch the appropriate rating to supply the load, but the problem is because the semiconductor components with suitable voltage capability are not available. On the other hand, the need to increase the voltage level of electrical energy conversion system and the difficulties to increasing the voltage capability of semiconductor components, triggering the efforts to create new structures of static converters, one of the new structure is multicell converters. This new structure not allows conversion of high voltage electrical energy especially all problem related to the harmonics ripple.
Electrical converters plays a very important of many engineering including transportation, of example in the electric railway transportation system is required the supply of a DC voltage with rating of 500 Volts, but the available DC voltage source is commonly in the level of 1500 Volt. This study will analyze the DC-DC converter of multicell topology and its modeling, and then proposed a voltage decreasing DC converter that can be applied as power supply of electrical train. By this method the converter can be operated on high enough voltage by using the standard semiconductors components only. One of the processes used to decrease the applied voltage is a direct reduction using a single DC chopper, but this way is very risky because if there is a damage of semiconductor component in the converter will experience a high voltage directly from the source to the load.

We chose corn, rice, sweet potato, lotus root and grapefruit from modern agricultural demonstration zone of Liang ping County as the study object. And sampling areas were mainly affected by the high geological background of heavy metals or industrial activities. By comparing, we got the following understanding, 1)regardless of industrial area or geological background area, contents of As, Hg and Cd in rice are always higher than those in maize. Contents of Cu, Zn, and Ni in maize are always higher than those in rice. Rice and maize have different enrichment characteristics for different heavy metals; 2)the hazard quotient of crops is proportional to the concentration of heavy metals. The hazard quotient of As, Hg, Cd, Zn, and Ni in maize is higher than that in the high background area, due to the influence of industrial activities on the forms of heavy metals in soil; 3)the hazard quotient of grapefruit is generally low and the hazard quotient of As element of lotus root reaches 2.08 for high geological background area, with significant health risk; and 4)the contribution rate of heavy metal elements to the total hazard quotient shows that the contribution rate of As and Cu to the whole area is the highest.

carticle_0166163715,The Influence of Social Capital on Proper Risk Allocation in Construction Projects,"Construction projects are mushrooming in China. There are more risks in construction projects than manufacturing projects because all projects must be unique and cannot be repeated. The contractual relationship between the owner and the contractor is related to risk allocation issues. Many projects find that project success depends on the proper allocation of all the risks in a project.However,there are still some cases which are inconsistent with this view in practice. The most probable reason is that economic activities are always embedded in social relations. Therefore,the influence of risk allocation on project management performance depends on the social capital of the owner and the contractor. The whole framework of risk allocation is decomposed based on the influence of social capital on proper risk allocation in the construction project.Firstly,a theoretical model about social capital and proper risk allocation is proposed based on the literature review. In the theoretical model,risk allocation in a construction project is regarded as a static one-time process from the perspective of incomplete contract. Risk allocation is divided into risk allocation in the contract and risk is re-allocated during the performance of the contract.The two dimensions of the former include a complete degree of the first risk allocation and the ex post supporting institution. The two dimensions of the latter include risk reallocation scale and efficiency. On the other hand,trust,relationship,and norm are identified as three dimensions of social capital according to the existing literatures. This study proposes hypotheses about the effect of social capital on every dimension of risk allocation.Secondly,after excluding the influence of project's complexity,project management mode,and market status on proper risk allocation,30 successful construction projects were selected as the research samples of this study. Data collected from these samples and statistical tests are carried out to test the theoretical model using the structural equation modeling method. The empirical results showed that:( 1) risk allocation and risk reallocation highly complement each other,among which supporting institution's ex post effect on the efficiency of risk reallocation is the most significant;( 2) social capital has strong negative effect on the complete degree of the first risk allocation and can help increase the ex post supporting institution significantly. In addition,the total effect of social capital on the ex post supporting institution is relatively strong; and( 3) social capital has significant and positive effect on risk reallocation scale and efficiency. In addition,the total effect of social capital on the efficiency of risk reallocation is the largest.Third,the awareness of risk allocation for both the owner and the contractor should be changed from a static and on-off course to a dynamic and adjustable course. The whole framework of risk allocation including first risk allocation and risk reallocation should be reasonably arranged from an overall point of view. Social capital is a key influencing factor when formulating the first risk allocation scheme in the contract and it has significant positive effect on risk reallocation.In summary,this study can help the owner and the contractor more properly allocate risks according to their social capital.

Virtually, all further population growth will take place in cities of developing countries, in which the rate of urbanization is faster than developed countries. If urbanization is unplanned and rapid, it is prone to informal settlements with insufficient housing, poor sanitary conditions and crowding all of which accelerate the spread of diseases (3,4). According to the latest 2011 estimates from UN-Habitat there are around 850 million urban dwellers in slums and slum like conditions globally with over 500 million of them in Asia-pacific cities. As reported in census (2011) there are around 6.5 crore slum dwellers in India. In Maharashtra alone there are 256 statutory towns out of which 189 towns encompass 1,18,48423 slum population.

The objectives of the study were:* To assess the maternal and child health care status including access to preventive health care services.* To study the morbidity and mortality pattern among women and children.* To study the nutritional status of women and children in slumsMethodsThe database of the study is drawn from the survey carried out on 400 households in four slum clusters in Delhi in the year 2013-2014 over a period of eight months. In order to select sample households, two stage stratified random sampling framework was used based on the DDA list, which gave complete details of all non-notified slums in Delhi. In the first step, Delhi was divided into seven zones on the basis of the 70 constituencies given in the Delhi Development Authority list. However, it may be noted that this list dated back to 1994 and over the years various clusters have either been removed or rehabilitated. In the second stage of the sampling process out of seven zones four zones were selected that is North, South, East and West and separate list of slums following within this zone was prepared.Once the specific cluster from all four zones were identified on the basis of the random Sampling, the number of sample households was distributed using the proportion of the number of households in each cluster to the total number of households in all four clusters as weights, thus arriving at 400 households across four zones. In all 1,007 males and 990 females were interviewed within different age groups.

One of the main most severest complications of malignant tumors remain are metastatic lesions of the central nervous system whose proportion increases as with the patients’ longlivity. Cerebral metastases of malignant tumors are encountered more often than primary neoplasms of the central nervous system. The brain is not only a hormone-dependent organ the effect of sex hormones as early the embryonic state conditions normal development of the body as a whole and controls the sex related differentiation. It is known that neurons and glyocites like gonads and adrenal glands are able to produce steroid hormones. The enzymes responsible for the synthesis of neurosteroids were detected in the brain tissue in the embryonic period of the development. The human brain is not only a hormone-dependent organ effect influence of sex hormones as early as in the embrional state conditiones normal development of the body as a whole and controls sexual gender differentiation. It is known that neurons and glyocytes like gonads and adrenal glands are able to produce steroid hormones. Enzymes responsible for synthesis of neurosteroids were revealed in cerebral tissue both in during the embryonic period of the development and in adult condition. Besides there are have been obtained large amount of data on the presence in the cerebral cells of receptors to steroidal hormones. In various periods of life the influence effect exerted by steroids on nervous cells can change the morphofunctional state of the brain and manifests as altering myelinization, neuronal growth, and differentiation of nerve cells. The present study was aimed at comparing the level of certain some hormones in tissue of glioblastomes, metastases of breast cancer into the brain and meningiomas, as well as the respective peritumoral zones. Materials and methods. Examined were samples of tissue obtained from a total of 56 patients admitted for operative treatment to our Department. Of these, 24 glioblastomas, 19 breast cancer metastases to the brain, 13 meningiomes without peritumoral edema. The histological control was carried out in all cases. The patients’ age varied form 35 to 72 years. During operative interventions we carried out removed neoplasms of the brain followed by biochemical study of the samples of tumor tissue and immediately adjoining to the tumorous foci tissue (perifocal zone). In 10 % of cytozolic fractions of tissue prepared on the potassium-phosphate buffer of pH 7.4 containing 0.15 of Tween-20 and 1 % of bovine serum albumin by means of immunoenzymatic assay (IEA) using standard test systems we determined the level of steroid hormones – cortisole, testosterone, progesterone, estradiole, estriole, prolactine (IEA, HEMA, Russia) estrone (IEA, DBC, Canada) as well as sex-steroid-binding globulin (IEA, Alcor-Bio, Russia) and hormones of adrenohypophysis – adrenocorticotropine (ACTH) and somatotropic hormone (STH). Results. The obtained findings showed that the most hormonally saturated were metastases of breast cancer. In them along with elevated levels of cortisole, prolactine ACTH and STH concentrations whose concentrations increased virtually in any proliferative process we determined growth of saturation of tissues with estrone and free testosterone on the background of decrease level of active metabolite of estrogens – estriole. Besides, disorders of the steroid metabolism also touched the perifocal zone. Presence of glioblastoma turned out characteristic of identity of tumorous tissue and the perifocal zone by the level of cortizole, which is not found observed if tumors of other genesis. In case of glioblastoms and their perifocal zones the ratio of cortizole to ACTH excedded the norm 2.1–2.5-fold. Meningiomas revealed high concentration of cortisole, ACTH, prolactine, STH, testosterone and sex-binding globulin, as well as a low level of progesterone. In the present study meningiomas turned out liders of production of prolactine and STH as well as estriolle with sufficiently low activity.

In an opinion that implicated issues related to class actions, the Erie doctrine, federalism, and the allocation of power between Congress and the Supreme Court, five Justices held that Federal Rule 23 should apply. Dissenting with three other Justices, Justice Ginsburg complained that the Court had sanctioned the plaintiff’s attempt to “transform a $500 case into a $5,000,000 award.” Even the five Justices that agreed that Federal Rule 23 should apply, however, disagreed about the reasoning. The disagreement primarily was driven by the relative weight that each Justice assigned to the competing policy interests — the need for an easily administrable rule, the need for fidelity to statutory text, and the need for deference to state legislatures — at stake. Shady Grove so fractured the Court that one commentator has suggested that there is a “need to reconsider the problem from the ground up.” In For Lack of a Better Rule: Using the Concept of Transsubstantivity to Solve the Erie Problem in Shady Gove, I argue that the competing policy interests that drove the disagreement do not actually have to be competing. Here, I propose a novel solution for deciding whether to apply a Federal Rule or a conflicting state law. As will be explained more fully in the Article, under this approach, a Federal Rule should trump a state law only when the conflicting state law is transsubstantive. This approach resolves the disagreement in Shady Grove because it is easily administrable, is faithful to the statutory text, and is sufficiently deferential to state legislatures.",Law!,[],False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

The experiments were conducted in the Korakundah (KR) and Upper Bhavani (UB) montane swamps of the Nilgiri Mountains (2200 m altitude). In each treatment, 46-50 flowers were emasculated from 15-22 plants at each swamp site. Manipulation experiments demonstrated that the geitonogamy produced, on average, lower fruit set (43%) and seed number (3.73 ± 0.18%) than the xenogamy treatment (fruit set (92%) and seed number (7.94 ± 0.06%). Fruit set (87%) and mean seed number (7.26 ± 0.14%) in the control set were not significantly different between two sites and no fruit set was recorded from the autogamy. The results suggest that I. rufescens is an obligate out-crosser and is partially self-incompatible. The self-incompatibility index (ISI) was calculated as 43/92 = 0.47% (between 0.2 and 1), the ratio of fruit set between the two sites. Each pollinator visit differed significantly from the total number of visits; however diverse insect visit was significantly higher between two sites.

To solve this problem, we proposed five key state parameters of FOCT, namely, junction temperature of SLDs, transmitting optical power of SLD, half-wave voltage of phase modulator, working temperature of fiber sensing coil, and the received optical power of photo detector. Analyzing the experimental results of these parameters, we quantitatively proposed the impact of the key state parameters on FOCT accuracy for the first time.Furthermore, we put forward the methods for monitoring and controlling each key state parameters respectively with experimental verification. The test results show that the ratio error and phase error of the FOCT product by state monitoring is lower than 0.1% and 3′, respectively, over a temperature range of -40 ℃~70 ℃.

carticle_0213604550,No time to philosophize : Norwegian oral tradition and the cognitive economics of belief,"The article employs a cognitive narratological approach to elements of the oral tradition from the Norwegian province Telemark, attempting to utilize tools developed in the cognitive science of religion for historiographical case studies. The aim is to identify and account for recurring patterns both in the style and content of folk religious tales, giving way to an improved analysis of fragmented and - due to the process of textualization - ambiguous sources. Instead of asking for the ""believed"" substrate of the folk religious oral tradition, the analysis focuses on the stylistic function of counterintuitive concepts in the narrative context of legends about the Hidden People. Against the backdrop of cognitive story processing theory (Zwaan and Radvansky), it is shown how the narrators applied a set of narrative techniques suitable for utilizing basic cognitive mechanisms of sensory and narrative processing to create credibility. The basic traits of the legends are shown to maximize cognitive effort in story processing, forcing the recipient to recognize the coherence between highly heterogeneous information and to position him- or herself with respect to the ambivalence of the stories. This cognitive effort is often resolved by reference to superempirical elements, which are not provided in the story, but concluded by the recipient. The narrative culture not only kept their belief in the Hidden People alive, but provided an experiential reality where official Christian doctrine, skeptical thought, and traditional belief elements were synthesized, forming a dynamic field of discourse.

Various infant formulas have many similarities to HBM in many components, but there is no perfect substitute for HBM. Recently, various breast milk components and their roles have been studied according to the development of various analysis techniques. As is already well known, HBM contains about 87%-88% water, and 124- g/L solid components as macronutrients, including about 7% (60-70 g/L) carbohydrates, 1% (8-10 g/L) protein, and 3.8% (35-40 g/L) fat. The composition may vary depending on the environmental factors, including maternal diet. Colostrum is low in fat but high in protein and relatively rich in immuneprotective components. Although HBM contains enough vitamins to ensure normal growth of the infant, vitamins D and K may be insufficient, and the infant may require their supplementation. Growth factors in HBM also serve as various bioactive proteins and peptides on the intestinal tract, vasculature, nervous system, and endocrine system. In the past, HBM of a healthy mother was thought to be sterile. However, several subsequent studies have confirmed the presence of rich and diverse microbial communities in HBM. Some studies suggested that the genera Staphylococcus and Streptococcus may be universally predominant in HBM, but the origin of microbiota still remains controversial. Lastly, milk is the one of most abundant body fluid of microRNAs, which are known to play a role in various functions, such as immunoprotection and developmental programming, through delivering from HBM and absorption by intestinal epithelial cells.

However, the process of annotation for SR is difficult due to the challenges like privacy and high manual cost, which results in a scarcity of labeled data samples. Also, for the datasets having less modality, the task of SR in a semi-supervised domain is sparsely explored and challenging. In this work, we analyze the effect of these two factors (sparse labels and low modality) which are critical for SR in ubiquitous data. We select two datasets of ubiquitous data that are relatively unexplored in the context of SR. The datasets, namely OPPOR-TUNITY and Smartphone used to perform SR using conventional supervised learning algorithms to benchmark the results. Then we perform extensive experimentation to analyze the effect of the aforementioned factors over the task of SR by studying the variations in classification accuracies. Next, we propose our semi-supervised framework for SR based on the concept of pseudo labels to counter the adverse effects of low modality and lack of labels. Experimental results show that our approach offers up to 77% and 98% accuracy on the Smartphone and OPPORTUNITY dataset respectively.",,['Computer science'],False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

This paper introduces a novel retinal image enhancement scheme based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) under fuzzy framework as it overcomes the problem of upgrading the imprecise nature of retinal image in traditional PSO system in the field of image enhancement. Firstly, two sub-images such as lower and upper in fuzzy regions of the image are determined by type-2 fuzzy system. Then,an S-shape membership function is utilized on lower and upper sub-images. An objective function such as index of fuzziness is optimized in terms of particle swarm optimization (PSO) system and it also defines the adaptive parameters which are incorporated with the proposed enhancement technique.

2.6–30 gene copies per mL. In Amersfoort, N3 was detected in sewage 6 days before
the first cases were reported. As the prevalence of COVID-19 in these cities increased
in March, the RNA signal detected by each qRT-PCR assay increased, for N1–N3 up

Rat cultured PAECs were transfected with a construct encoding GFP‐labeled TFAM (Transcription Factor A, Mitochondrial) ‐ a constitutive nucleoid protein ‐ and stained with MitoTracker Red. Confocal microscopy showed that TFAM‐GFP within MitoTracker‐stained organelles displayed a punctate appearance with multiple labeled structures per mitochondrion. Image analysis using either adjacent TFAM‐labeled structures or one mitochondrial pole as reference points showed that mitochondria and TFAM‐labeled structures were independently motile and that mtDNA‐damaging H2O2 caused an abrupt cessation of their movements. Mitochondrial and nucleoid movements persisted when H2O2‐damaged cells were pre‐treated with a mt‐targeted DNA repair enzyme.

To investigate the factors influencing the prevalence of echinococciasis in Gansu Province.


Methods
With the method of stratified random sampling, all the administrative villages in pastoral areas, half pastoral areas, agriculture and urban areas in the 72 counties in Gansu Province were selected; according to the layers of the population of the county population proportion calculated, the layer investigation numbers were determined, and a total of 16 administrative villages were selected in each county. In the 16 administrative villages, more than 200 people of permanent residents were surveyed in each village(shortage was made up from a nearby village), at least 3 200 people were investigated in a county. By using the combined method of inquiry and field observation, natural factors, such as drinking water, farming and animal husbandry production data were surveyed. All data were analyzed using SPSS 19.0 statistical software. Unary linear and multiple linear regression analysis of influencing factors and the relationship between the prevalence were analyzed.


Results
Unary linear regression analysis showed that longitudes, latitudes, altitudes, average annual temperature, annual rainfalls, secondary industries, animal husbandry towns, drinking water sources, the number of epidemic towns, epidemic villages, per capita net incomes in animal husbandry regions, the total number of livestock and the number of sheep were factors influencing the prevalence of echinococciasis (F= 4.705, P< 0.05). Latitude, altitude, animal husbandry towns, the number of epidemic towns, epidemic villages, per capita net incomes in animal husbandry regions, the total number of livestock and the number of sheep and the prevalence of echinococciasis was positively correlated (r= 0.282, 0.285, 0.387, 0.508, 0.540, 0.317, 0.475, 0.594, all P< 0.05); longitude, average annual temperature, annual rainfall, secondary industries, drinking water sources and the prevalence of echinococciasis was negatively correlated (r=-0.311, - 0.244, - 0.244, - 0.389, - 0.311, all P< 0.05). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that differences of interactions of annual rainfalls, drinking water sources, epidemic villages, per capita net incomes of herdsmen, secondary industries and the total number of livestock between groups were statistically significant (t=- 1.822, - 3.920, 3.013, 1.715, - 1.609, 3.264, all P< 0.05).


Conclusion
The factors influencing the prevalence of echinococciasis in Gansu Province are correlated with annual rainfalls, drinking water sources, epidemic villages, per capita net incomes of herdsmen, secondary industries and the total number of livestock.

Methods Cortical neurons were cultured from SD rats within 24 h after birth, and a H/R model was built. The immunofluorescence double staining and Western blot were used to detect the NSP expression in the cultured neurons. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay （ELISA） was used to detect the expression of tPA. Results After oxygenglucose deprivation （OGD） for 1.5 h, the expression of NSP protein was mildly up-regulated, and it reached the peak at 6 h after reoxygenation （P 〈 0.05）. Then it decreased slowly and basically restored to the level before hypoxia at 24 h after reoxygenation. The cells expressed a small amount of tPA at 1.5 h after OGD （P 〈 0.05 ）. With the extension of time for reoxygenation, the tPA content increased gradually. OGD was significantly higher at 6 h after reoxygenation than before （P 〈 0.01 ）. Then it decreased gradually, and it basically restored to the level before reoxygenation at 24 h after reoxygenation. Conclusions The expressions of NSP and tPA were up-regulated significantly during neuron H/R injury, and the ambulatory changes of NSP and tPA were basically the same.

Active tobacco use and passive smoking increase the risk of infection. Both increase peribronchial and alveolar inflammation and fibrosis and mucosal permeability, cause inadequate mucociliary cleaning, damage to the respiratory tract epithelium resulting in fibrosis, and they adversely affect cellular and humoral immunity. Smoking has been known to increase the risk for viral infections and influenza. Similar data have been approved found for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Smoking is reported to be associated with the frequency of the disease and its severity of the clinical course. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 penetrates the cell using the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors. Such receptor proteins had been shown to increase in smoker individuals. Also, smoking facilitates penetration of the virus into the cell. The frequency of smoking and the rates of admission to intensive care, mechanical ventilation, and mortality have been also found to be higher was higher in severe cases. The risk for disease progression was found to be 14-fold higher in smokers. Further, the World Health Organization emphasized similar negative effects of hookah and new tobacco products such as electronic cigarettes and heated tobacco products.

This study investigates the strain‐hardening behavior of an AA6060 alloy processed by equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) up to 12 passes. Analysis by electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) shows that the average geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) density increases continually up to the fourth pass and then saturates at a value of ≈1.85 × 1014 m−2. Hollomon and Kocks–Mecking–Estrin (KME) analysis are used to investigate the strain‐hardening behavior of the resulting ultrafine‐grained alloy. Results indicate that the strain‐hardening capacity (HC) and the strain‐hardening exponent (n) of all deformed specimens are lower in comparison with the as‐received condition. Moreover, the strain‐hardening rate fluctuates with the ECAP passes. First, it increases from the first ECAP pass up to the fourth pass, then diminishes up to the fifth pass, and finally, it increases again with further deformation. The difference in the strain‐hardening behavior of the ECAPed AA6060 is examined in terms of the grain size effect. It is shown that the strain‐hardening curves change notably with diminishing the grain size. In addition, the KME model is used to depict the storage and annihilation of dislocations in the ECAPed specimens. Herein, the effect of equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) on Strain hardening of AA6060‐T6 alloy is investigated. Hollomon and Kocks–Mecking–Estrin (KME) analysis are implemented to understand the deformation behavior of ECAPed specimens.

In the animal nervous system, a systematic shift toward distal sites of transcription termination produces transcript signatures that are crucial for neuron development and function. Here, we report that, in Drosophila, the highly conserved protein ELAV globally regulates all sites of neuronal 3′ end processing and directly binds to proximal polyadenylation sites of target mRNAs in vivo. We uncover an endogenous strategy of functional gene rescue that safeguards neuronal RNA signatures in an ELAV loss-of-function context. When not directly repressed by ELAV, the transcript encoding the ELAV paralog FNE acquires a mini-exon, generating a new protein able to translocate to the nucleus and rescue ELAV-mediated alternative polyadenylation and alternative splicing. We propose that exon-activated functional rescue is a more widespread mechanism that ensures robustness of processes regulated by a hierarchy, rather than redundancy, of effectors.",,['Biology'],False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Objective To explore the association of neuropeptide Y gene rs16147 (-485C/T or-399C/T) polymorphism with cerebral infarction (CI) in Han population in Hunan province, and the possible influence of this SNP on blood pressure, serum lipid and fasting glucose.
Methods Allelic specific primer polymerase chain reaction (ASP-PCR) was performed to identify the distributions of allele and genotype frequencies of SNP rs16147 polymorphism in neuropeptide Y gene in 238 patients with CI and 162 healthy controls. Meanwhile we tested the levels of blood pressure, serum lipid, fasting glucose and BMI. About 10% of the samples were randomly selected to be genotyped again by DNA sequencing, and the results were 100% concordant. All data was analyzed by SPSS 13.0.
Results
1. NPY gene rs16147 polymorphism exists in Chinese people of Hunan area. The TT, TC and CC genotype frequencies of rs16147 in CI and control groups were 0.168/0.370/0.462 and 0.123/0.389/0.488 respectively. The T/C allele frequencies of rs16147 in CI and control groups were 0.353/0.647 and 0.318/0.682 respectively. No significant differences were observed in genotype and allele frequencies of rs 16147 between CI and control groups (P>0.05). The difference of the distribution of rs 16147 polymorphism was also not significant between subgroups of CI with HBP, DM and CHD or not (P>0.05). Logistic regression analysis suggested that not any genotypes could increase or decrease the risk of onset of CI (P>0.05).
2. The levels of blood pressure, serum lipid and fasting glucose were significant different in control group with CI group (P<0.05). And the TT genotype subgroup had significant higher level of HDL-C than TC genotype or CC genotype subgroups in the CI group (P<0.05). No difference in levels of BMI, SBP, DBP, TC, TG, LDL-C and FBS was found among genotype subgroups in statistics (P>0.05).
Conclusions
1. The rs16147 polymorphism of NPY gene may not correlate with CI in Chinese Han population in Hunan province.
2. The rs16147 polymorphism of NPY gene may be not associated with blood pressure and glucose, but may be associated with HDL-C level. The Carriers of C allele may be involved in low level of HDL-C. The roles of NPY gene rs16147 polymorphism in serum lipid need to be studied further.

carticle_0264268962,Study on Global Stability Evaluation and Failure Mechanism of Dense Storage Cavern Group in Salt Rock,"Dense storage cavern group in salt rock is involved with global stability evaluation,failure surge mechanism, interaction and temporal and spatial evolution of cavern group,which are the key isues need to be solved urgently in the design and construction ofcavern group. The deformation reinforcement theory (DRT) under the framework of3Dnonlinear finite element method provides a new and unified theory and method to studythe above problems. In this dissertation, the influence of all kinds of instability factors isstudied based on an unified and quantitative global stability criterion of salt rock densestorage cavern group. The geomtchanical model test of salt rock cavern group is carriedout, and the computational results are compared with model tests results. The DRT isextended to the visco-plastic theory and time-dependent deformation and damageevolution are considered.The main research work and findings are as follows:
(1) The relation curve between plastic complementary energy and strengthreduction factor (K～△E relation curve) is used as the quantitative key criterion ofglobal stability in cavern group, and the unbalanced force is used as the effectiveindicator of cavern failure. Based on the unified and quantitative criterion of all kinds ofinstability factors (K～△E relation curve), the influence of factors such as cavernshape, cavern diameter, cavern space, cavern depth, mudstone intercalation, caverngroup internal pressure, cavern group pressure loss, cavern group layout to the globalstability of salt rock dense cavern group is studied. The global stability and failureananlysis of oil and gas storage cavern group in Jintan salt mine is carried out.
(2) Based on that unbalanced force is the internal effective driving force of failure,the interaction and failure surge mechanism of storage cavern group is revealed. Thecritical space of storage cavern is determined and it is found that there are two differentfailure patterns when the cavern space is less or greater than critical space.
(3) The geomtchanical model test of salt rock four-cavern group is carried out, andthe computational results are compared with model tests results. The unbalanced forcedistribution law of numerical simulation and falure position and pattern of model testindicate that there is a good correlation beween unbalanced force and failure, and therefore the effectiveness and accuracy of DRT in the global stability and faureanalysis are verified.
(4) The DRT is extended to the visco-plastic theory and time-dependentdeformation and damage evolution are considered. The DRT consideringspatio-temporal evolution is developed. Based on the relation curve between plasticcomplementary energy and time (T～△E relation curve), the method of globalstability evaluation and failure spatio-temporal evolution analysis during the processof non-equilibrium evolution of salt rock cavern group is realized. The spatio-temporalevolution ananlysis of double-cavern of salt rock and oil and gas storage cavern groupin Jintan salt mine under pressure loss is carried out, and the results indicate theavailability and effectiveness of DRT in rheological long-term stability and failurespatio-temporal evolution analysis.

carticle_0264408132,The Research of the Sealing Gasket in Axially Split Pump,"Rubber gasket is widely used in the petrochemical industry, while in the pump industry, gasket plays a significant role in sealing, especially in the high-pressure, high temperature environment, therefore, the expectation on the sealing gasket is comparatively higher.
In the current stage, all gaskets that we use are imported, and in the trend of localization, we are bound to face domestic substitutes because of the lower costs, which makes the localization of gasket one of the main work we need to do; also because of the big differences and uncertainties between domestic and imported gaskets, we are going to consider choosing one close long-term cooperating vendor to make a suitable replacement, which will be the option to localize the sealing gasket in the hydraulic test step firstly.
Although China has a variety of non-asbestos fibers rubber gasket, but most of them are single fiber-reinforced rubber gasket, which have limits to a narrow temperature range, high manufacturing cost, anti-aging properties and poor creep relaxation problems. On the other hand, the imported sealing gasket is made by hybrid fiber to reinforce the rubber material, in which way it can get the advantages of a variety of fibers to get a better high temperature performance, adequate strength and toughness, high corrosion resistance as well. So the author considers using the hybrid fiber to do the research and prepare the local sealing gasket for replacement.
In this article, we will use the domestic sealing gasket in hydraulic test of pumps which have advanced technology, so we will study the performance parameters of the imported gaskets and combined with the practice testing to prepare the suitable local gasket type whose parameters are close to the imported ones. Main research and verification processes are as below:
First, study and analysis the imported gasket's performance and components used in the manufacturing process to determine the composition of its main components and what the major roles these components are playing.
Second, study the effect of aramid fiber and glass fiber in rubber gasket material by mechanical performance tests, which were prepared by local.
Then following is to prepare the hybrid fiber-reinforced rubber gasket by the main component of aramid fiber and glass fiber, and mechanical and resistance test are to be done to get the properties of this kind of gasket.
Finally, carry out the actual pressure test with prepared samples to verify the sealing gasket's property and pressure distribution on the gasket's surface; integrated these verification process to ensure the local prepared gasket can be used to replace the imported sealing gasket in after-coming test processes, and achieve the purpose of gasket localization in end.

their management and investment decisions to better manage and invest.From now on,credit risk measurement models mainly include financial indicator ratio model logistic model and quantitative credit risk model KMV model.The calculation characteristics of financial statements and financial indicators themselves have some shortcomings such as hysteresis and quiescence at time points.Therefore,although the former model is relatively simple in practical application,the calculation results also have the disadvantage of hysteresis,failing to capture the rapid changes of the capital market.Mainly through the capital market theory after a model of information data analysis,rather than the book financial information of the company,more timely analysis the situation of listed companies,and that financially troubled risk size,this model has also been a lot of companies abroad application,and formed a default database effectively,but also at home is still in the study,has not yet formed a default database,finally it is concluded that the KMV model variables EDF in the absence of a default database can't exactly,can only roughly estimate.Based on 90 listed companies as samples,this paper on the basis of KMV model,on first according to the situation of our country to adjust some of the parameters of the KMV model,and then calculate the samples of listed companies by using the model of default distance DD,at the same time,the descriptive statistical analysis of the DD,preliminary judging DD of financial distress on the discrimination ability of the company;In the second step,after screening out some appropriate financial indicators,the default distance obtained from KMV model was introduced into the logistic model as an indicator to judge its ability to distinguish companies with high credit risks.Finally,the ROC curves of the above two groups of models were compared and their test effects were evaluated.Empirical results show that after the inclusion of default distance DD,the logistic model's discrimination accuracy of ST and non-st companies is much higher than that of the individual default distance DD.Finally,it is concluded that although the default distance DD can better distinguish financial distressed companies,the logistic model with the default distance index has better discriminating ability,and both the discriminating ability and the the continuous expansion of the global securities market and the deepening of the opening up of China's financial industry,Chinese listed companies are facing more fierce competition and greater risks while meeting the opportunities of reform and development.Banks,corporate management and market investors all need an effective financial distress warning system to help them make decisions.The current financial crisis warning model can be divided into two categories:the financial ratio model represented by logistic model and the credit risk quantification model represented by K.MV model.Although the former model is easy to operate,the characteristics of financial statements themselves determine that it has defects such as quiescence and hysteresis,which cannot reflect the rapid and subtle changes in the capital market.The latter model relies on capital market information rather than book information.Theoretically,it can timely,scientifically and dynamically reflect the current operating status of listed companies,and it has been widely used abroad.However,due to the special national conditions of the absence of default database,EDF,the final output variable of the model,cannot be obtained in China.This paper takes 90 listed companies as samples and expands the model in two steps.First,after adjusting the KMV model according to the actual situation in China,it estimates the default distance DD of the samples according to the KMV model and makes descriptive statistical analysis to preliminarily judge the ability of this index to distinguish financial crisis companies from financial health companies.Secondly.DD of default distance was taken as a variable and other screened variables were introduced into the logistic model constituted by the logistic model.Finally,ROC curves of the above two groups of models were compared and analyzed for their test effects.Empirical results show that after DD is included in the default distance,logistic mode]has a much higher accuracy in identifying ST and non-st companies than that of DD alone.Therefore,it can be seen that the default distance variable can better reflect the financial situation 'of listed companies in China.After adding the default distance variable,the financial distress early warning model has been significantly improved in terms of its discrimination ability and model goodness of

carticle_0265218411,The Study on the Competitive Strategy of Each Mode of Transport in the Regional Passenger Transport Corridor Based on the Game Theory,"In recent years, with the rapid development of Chinese socio-economic requirements, the transportation industry has been developing rapidly. The rapid rise of high-speed railway not only meet the increasing demand for passenger transportation with other means of transport, but also has brought a certain impact to other modes of transportation. This impact will bring the competition among the various modes of transport. In order to avoid the negative effects of various unhealthy competitions of various modes of transport, this paper analyzed and studied the game process with the actual situation. Then by use of the equilibrium results of the article, we can not only give advice to all modes of transport how to choose the strategy and action, but also provide certain reference to help the government traffic management department to make a balance between the competition. This approach has a certain practical significance. This paper selected the regional passenger transport corridor for competitive environment, then chosen passenger transport market competition object, finally analyzed all modes' competition strategy selection by game theory.After present situation in home and abroad are summarized, this paper divided the passenger market into six sub markets according to the passenger income levels and purpose of travel, then analyzed the factors which affecting passenger choices in depth and detail. After that, the factors have been simplified for five decisive factors: safety, price, speed, comfort and convenience. Nest, the indicators of time's economic value has been used in the quantization of the decisive factors and determination of the decisive factor's weight. Then the traveler's benefit function has been given based on the above. In order to reduce the effect of game process, the improved gravity model has been used to forecast the passenger flow which is closely related to the game process.Based on the characteristics and development status of the passenger transport modes in China, this paper analyzed the modes' competitiveness from three aspects: the economic and technical characteristics, the cost of passenger transport and the sharing of passenger transport. Then the improved Logit model has been adopted in the forecast of passenger transport share. After that, the method of make the passenger travel benefits equal has been used to delimit every mode's competitive distance. This method based on the each mode's advantages and disadvantages. Then we obtained the distance range of every mode in relation to every passenger transport sub market.After the corresponding analysis of participants, optional strategies, game process In the game of regional transport corridor, this paper constructed a price game model and a speed game model which choose maximize the social benefit as the objective function. Then the solutions of these models were selected by three algorithms: particle swarm optimization algorithm, adaptive mutation particle group method, immune particle swarm optimization algorithm. Then these algorithms have been realized.This paper selected Lan-Xin passenger transport corridor for empirical research. The results found that immune particle swarm algorithm is most suitable optimization algorithm for solving these models. Finally, some conclusions has been obtained : In the shorter distance segment of Lan-Xin passenger transport corridor, the price game of common rail, high speed railway and highway transportation showing a situation of tripartite confrontation; In the longer distance segment of Lan-Xin passenger transport corridor, the high speed railway occupies the absolute advantage whether in the overall passenger market or in the high-end passenger market.but its speed still has some room for growth, that means if we can break the difficulties of Lan-Xin high speed railway's speed increasing,it will bring greater social benefits. Based on the analyses of the competitive equilibrium results in Lan-Xin passenger transport corridor's three representative distance range, this paper proposed corresponding suggestions to each mode of transport about the competitive strategy finally.",,['Economics'],False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

These species appeared mostly in the forest vegetation of Dahurian Birch (Betula davurica) and Japanese alder (Alnus japonica), which are grown in the valley in our study area. The appearance of woodpeckers is assumed to correlate with the woodpeckers' foraging activity for insects living in the soil. The soil moisture of the forest was thought to affect the inhabitation of insects. The population of grey faced green woodpecker increased with an increase in the tree diameter at breast height (DBH), while that of two other species increased only with small to medium tree DBH (20-25 cm).

significantly higher than the sum of single drug effects,which confirmed that ATO and DHA could synergistically enhance ROS production,while the pretreatment of ROC scavenger NAC could partially reduce ROS production level;(7)Western blot assay showed that the expression level of DNA damage protein γ-H2 AX in Jurkat cells was much higher than the sum of single drug effects after combined action of DHA and ATO(8)The results of annexin V-FITC/PI flow cytometry and immunofluorescence c-caspase-3 activity showed that compared with the control group,the apoptosis rate of cells treated with ATO or DHA was significantly increased,while the increase of apoptosis rate of cells caused by combination of two drugs was greater than the sum of apoptosis rate of cells caused by single drug.(9)After NAC pretreatment,the activity and proliferation of Jurkat cells and MOLT-4 cells treated with DHA and ATO were restored.Conclusion DHA has a significant effect in acute T-lymphocytic leukemia.It may be involved in the anti-tumor mechanism of DHA by activating DHA induced ROS production in Jurkat and MOLT-4 cells,causing DNA damage,activating the P53 apoptotic pathway,and promoting apoptosis.DHA and ATO can induce DNA damage and apoptosis of all cells by activating oxidative

Self-assembly is a prerequisite for the catalysis, since the catalytic peptides do not display any activity in the absence of the gold nanocluster. Atomistic simulations reveal details of the association dynamics as regulated by defined conformational changes of the peptide due to peptide length and sequence.

Subsequently, ballistic tests with eighteen bolted casing-flange structure specimens were conducted to validate the failure evaluation criterion. Parameter studies were then carried out using the validated FE models. Both the experimental and numerical results demonstrated the accuracy of the failure evaluation criterion. The failure evaluation criterion provided a quick and easy way to determine the failure mode of the casing connection area by using the materials and dimensions of the structure. Based on the failure evaluation criterion, designing the structural failure mode of the bolted casing-flange structure to be between flange failure and bolt failure can improve the impact resistance of the connection area of the aero-engine casings. This investigation revealed that the impact failure is not the unique criterion in evaluating the containment of the casing connection area, structural failure should also be involved in the evaluation criteria.

However both traditional and machine learning methods are concerned with modeling the joint distribution between endogenous (target) and exogenous (input) variables. The fitted models are themselves functionals of the data,about which we can do statistical inference using computationally intensive methods such as the bootstrap. Where linear models describe the fitted relationship between the target and input variables via the slope of that relationship (coefficient estimates), the same fitted relationship can be described rigorously for any machine learning model by first-differencing the partial dependence functions. Bootstrapping these first-differenced functionals provides standard errors and confidence intervals for the estimated relationships. We show that this approach replicates the point estimates of coefficients attained in a linear OLS models, and demonstrate how this generalizes to marginal relationships in ML/AI models. This paper extends the partial dependence plot described in Friedman (2001), and visualizes the marginal distribution used to construct the PDP as described in Goldstein et al. (2015) before applying the steps described above. We further discuss the extension of PDP into a Shapley value decomposition and explore how it can be used to further explain modeloutputs.

This review is aimed to introduce the principle and protocol of AFM-based SMFS including the setup, the working principle, typical curves, the choice of AFM tip and substrate, immobilization of samples, manipulation of the device, empirical criteria for single-molecule stretching and data analysis. Recent progresses on the application of AFM-based SMFS in the characterization of synthetic polymers and biopolymers were reviewed. For synthetic polymers, the effects of primary chemical compositions, side groups, tacticity and solvents on the single chain elasticities were discussed. The applications of AFM-SMFS in disclosing the structure of unknown molecule, polymer-interface interactions and polymer interactions in polymer assemblies (e.g., polymer single crystal) were introduced. In addition, the nature of mechanochemical reactions and characterization of supramolecular polymers were realized via this technic. For biopolymers, the effects of base-pair number, the force-loading mode (unzipping or shearing) on the stability of short double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) were reviewed.

carticle_0289202257,"The Implications of Being ""In it Together"": Relationship Satisfaction and Joint Health Behaviors Predict Better Health and Stronger Concordance Between Partners.","BACKGROUND: Extensive evidence shows that satisfying marriages boost physical health and longevity. A separate literature reveals strong concordance in couples' health, but the relationship processes that contribute to health concordance remain poorly understood.
PURPOSE: The current study examined whether relationship satisfaction and joint health behaviors-the extent to which couples eat, sleep, and exercise together-are associated simultaneously with better health and greater health similarity between partners.
METHODS: Heterogeneous variance multilevel models were applied to data from 234 married couples (Mage = 46, Range = 20-84) reporting on their relationship satisfaction, joint health behaviors, and four health indicators-health satisfaction, depressive symptoms, comorbidities, and medication use.
RESULTS: More satisfied couples engaged in more joint health behaviors than less satisfied counterparts. When joint health behaviors and relationship satisfaction were examined as separate fixed effects, both predicted greater health satisfaction and fewer depressive symptoms. More joint health behaviors were also associated with less medication use. When both were modeled together, only relationship satisfaction predicted depressive symptoms. By contrast, in random effects, joint health behaviors predicted greater similarity in health satisfaction, depressive symptoms, and comorbidities. Relationship satisfaction only predicted more similar depressive symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Although more satisfied couples engaged in more joint health behaviors. relationship satisfaction and joint health behaviors uniquely predicted couples' health quality and concordance, suggesting that distinct mechanisms may drive better health and stronger health resemblance.",,"['Psychology', 'Medicine']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False

The spearmint grew well and plant heights above ground were not significantly different between the gravel (57.7 +/- 13.1 cm), raft (58.0 +/- 17.7 cm) and grow pipe components (63.6 +/- 9.9 cm). Root lengths and root fresh weights were two-fold and four-fold higher in raft (64.3 +/- 20.5 cm; 42.8 +/- 29.9 g) and grow pipes (59.4 +/- 15.2 cm; 41.3 +/- 25.7 g) compared with gravel substrate (29.7 +/- 7.8 cm; 9.4 +/- 9.4 g; raft = grow pipes > gravel). Spearmint leaf number was significantly higher in the grow pipes (770.0 +/- 224.4) than in the gravel substrate (499.8 +/- 228.4) with intermediate values in the raft. Significantly highest mean fresh biomass was found in the raft (1275.6 +/- 33.4 g), followed by grow pipes (1042.0 +/- 35.8 g) and gravel substrate (686.3 +/- 98.2 g; raft > grow pipes > gravel). M. spicata, under aquaponics, grows best in grow pipe and raft components.

carticle_0290076527,Role of Occupational Therapy in Pain Management.,"The American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA) asserts that occupational therapists and occupational therapy assistants, collectively referred to as occupational therapy practitioners (AOTA, 2020b), are distinctly prepared to work independently and to contribute to interprofessional teams in the treatment of pain. Occupational therapy practitioners work to ensure active engagement in meaningful occupations for ""persons, groups, or populations (i.e., the client)"" (AOTA, 2020b, p. 1) at risk for and affected by pain.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS; 2019) has recognized pain as a public health problem that has significant physical, emotional, and societal costs, estimated at $560 billion to $635 billion annually in the United States. An estimated 50 million U. S. adults and 5% to 38% of children and adolescents are affected by chronic pain (Dahlhamer et al., 2018; HHS, 2019). According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM; 2011), "" pain is one of the most common reasons people seek treatment"" (p. 155). Pain has been found to affect a person's ability to exercise, enjoy normal sleep, perform household chores, attend social activities, drive a car, walk, have sexual relations, maintain relationships, and find enjoyment in life (Dorfman, 2018; World Health Organization [WHO], 2004). Efforts to improve care for people affected by pain have been influenced and, at times, complicated by initiatives to combat the opioid crisis (HHS, 2019). HHS has described the opioid crisis as lying at the intersection of two public health challenges: reducing the burden of suffering from pain and containing the harms resulting from prescription opioid medications. Unfortunately, initiatives to address the potential harms of opioid medications have had unintended consequences for some people with chronic pain, such as limited access to treatment for pain, stigma, and rising suicide rates ( HHS, 2019).",Social work,"['Medicine', 'Sociology']",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True

carticle_0290426369,Effect of ply and dimension on tensile properties of composite laminates with holes,"Based on the failure theory of fracture surface, a numerical model for progressive damage analysis of composite laminates with holes was established. After the failure of the fiber, the stiffness of the damaged area was directly reduced to 0.01% of the original value. After inter-fiber failure, the material properties in the damaged zone were softened linearly based on energy release rate. The effect of shear non-linearity on failure analysis was also considered in the model. Subsequently, the tensile failure process of composite laminates with different diameters and layers was simulated, and verified by physical tests. The results show that the calculation error is less than 10%, and the predicted failure mode is consistent with the test. Finally, the effects of layers and structure size on the failure mode and strength of laminates with holes were discussed. Under the same aperture, the failure modes of laminates with different layers are similar. Under the same layers, when the ratio of hole diameter to width is constant, the tensile strength decreases rapidly as the hole diameter increases.",,"['Materials science', 'Engineering']",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

                    High Accuracy Aligned Wafer Bonding for Wafer-Level Integration","Direct wafer bonding for SOI substrates manufacturing was probably the first volume production application based on bonding. As this application involves bonding of two non-patterned substrates the requirements for wafer-to-wafer alignment accuracy were very loose: mechanical (edge-to-edge) alignment with accuracies in the range of 50-100 µm was absolutely sufficient. For applications using other wafer bonding processes (the first sensors that were manufactured using glass frit bonding and anodic bonding) such rough alignment methods were still usable but in parallel optical alignment was adopted: in this case the alignment accuracy needs were going down to 5 – 20 µm. The increased device complexity of the applications which could benefit from wafer bonding advantages required for features from the bonding partners to be aligned to each other (either functional parts of the devices or structures necessary for the successful bonding process, such as bonding lines on both wafers): in such cases optical alignment became necessary and the technology progress was reflected also in more demanding requirements for the wafer-to-wafer optical alignment. For the early generations of these applications the required accuracy was still low, so it was possible to use adapted photolithography mask aligners. Later on, with higher accuracy requirements dedicated bond alignment systems were introduced in order to meet the tighter alignment specifications. With the adoption of direct (fusion) wafer bonding for backside illuminated (BSI) CMOS image sensors initially for consumer electronics this process found its way into the integration flow. For this application the device performance can be significantly improved by increasing the level of integration with the electronic components. For the first generations of devices the alignment accuracy was still not critical as one of the two substrates to be bonded did not have any electrically functional structures and optical alignment was required in order to guarantee a high yield for the patterning steps following the direct bonding and thinning of the CMOS image sensors wafer. This new application introduced a new requirement for direct bonding which was not considered before: besides the required alignment precision the need to simultaneously control the local wafer stress and deformation during the bonding process became crucial, as it leads to remaining distortion of the image sensor wafers. Patterns distortion causes problems with color filter manufacturing by subsequent stepper photolithography and ends up in cross talk between different colors. Especially for mobile devices the image sensors keep shrinking and combined with increasing the resolution at the same time the pixel sizes have reached levels where distortion levels below 50 nm are necessary. With further development of these image sensors also the second bonding partner wafer moved from the carrier wafer functionality to electrically active structures which required electrical connection to the image sensor wafer. Different integration schemes were developed, such as via last connection after the bonding where one wafer is thinned, vias are formed, which are subsequently filled with metal in order to achieve electrical connections. This paper aims to present an overview of the existing wafer-to-wafer alignment technology. The development of optical alignment methods will be reviewed with respect to applications requirements evolution over time. An overview of the different factors contributing to the overall misalignment budget and how they are controlled now or will be in the future in order to meet the stringent requirements will be presented with examples.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wafer_bonding,"['Engineering', 'Materials science']",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

Besides the direct harm the virus may cause to species that are very susceptible to human respiratory pathogens, the pandemic has also brought an economic crisis with lockdowns and absence from usual workplaces, resulting in increased poaching and habitat encroachment. The countries where the remaining apes live cannot shoulder alone the cost of conservation. Other countries with more resources have also contributed to ape extinction and are also implicated in the current pandemic. Moreover, international cooperation is essential for the conservation efforts needed to avoid depriving other hominids of their habitats, their cultures, and their future.",Ecology?,['Biology'],False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False
