    "title": "Adaptive field-of-view imaging for efficient receive beamforming in medical ultrasound imaging systems",
    "abstract": "Quadrature demodulation-based phase rotation beamforming (QD-PRBF) is commonly used to support dynamic receive focusing in medical ultrasound systems. However, it is computationally demanding since it requires two demodulation filters for each receive channel. To reduce the computational requirements of QD-PRBF, we have previously developed two-stage demodulation (TSD), which reduces the number of lowpass filters by performing demodulation filtering on summation signals. However, it suffers from image quality degradation due to aliasing at lower beamforming frequencies. To improve the performance of TSD-PRBF with reduced number of beamforming points, we propose a new adaptive field-of-view (AFOV) imaging method. In AFOV imaging, the beamforming frequency is adjusted depending on displayed FOV size and the center frequency of received signals. To study its impact on image quality, simulation was conducted using Field II, phantom data were acquired from a commercial ultrasound machine, and the image quality was quantified using spatial (i.e., axial and lateral) and contrast resolution. The developed beamformer (i.e., TSD-AFOV-PRBF) with 1024 beamforming points provided comparable image resolution to QD-PRBF for typical FOV sizes (e. g., 4.6% and 1.3% degradation in contrast resolution for 160 mm and 112 mm, respectively for a 3.5 MHz transducer). Furthermore, it reduced the number of operations by 86.8% compared to QD-PRBF. These results indicate that the developed TSD-AFOV-PRBF can lower the computational requirement for receive beamforming without significant image quality degradation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Cloud rendering comprises a set of services capable of rendering a 3D scene on a remote workstation. Notable progress in this field has been made by cloud gaming services. However, a gap remains between existing cloud rendering systems and other graphics-intensive applications, such as visualization of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models. Existing cloud gaming services are not suitable to efficiently render these particular 3D scenes. CAD models contain many more objects than a regular game scene, requiring specific assumptions and optimizations to deliver an interactive user experience.

Resolving contentions at the beginning of a frame allows for effective utilization of bandwidth. Our protocol essentially combines the benefits of TDMA architecture with the. distributed reservation mechanism of IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol, thereby performing well even at high loads. We implement a two-way handshake before each data slot to avoid deadlocks, a phenomena that plagues 802.11. Through theoretical analysis, we derive the system throughput achieved by our MAC protocol.

    "abstract": "In computer science and data mining, Apriori is a classic algorithm for learning association rules. Apriori is designed to operate on databases containing transactions (for example, collections of items bought by customers, or details of a website frequentation). Frequent itemsets play an essential role in many data mining tasks that try to find interesting patterns from databases, such as association rules, correlations, sequences, episodes, classifiers, clusters and many more of which the mining of association rules is one of the most popular problems. In this paper, we take the classic Apriori algorithm, and improve it quite significantly by introducing what we call a vertical sort. We then use the large dataset, web documents to contrast our performance against several state-of-the-art implementations and demonstrate not only equal efficiency with lower memory usage at all support thresholds, but also the ability to mine support thresholds as yet un-attempted in literature. We also indicate how we believe this work can be extended to achieve yet more impressive results. We have demonstrated that our implementation produces the same results with the same performance as the best of the state-of-the art implementations. In particular, we have started with the classic algorithm for this problem and introduced a conceptually simple idea, sorting the consequences of which have permitted us to outperform all of the available state-of-the-art implementations.",

Since HT (>11 kVA) and EHT (Extra High Tension > 66 kVA) customers in the designated DISCOM region demand continuous power supply, reducing interruption hours and feeder outages are two most important factors draw attentions of Utility Service Providers. It has been found that accurate prediction of Peak Load Demand for a day ahead can remarkably reduce the above two parameters.

The blockchain ecosystem maintains an immutable transaction record to support many types of digital services. This paper compares the performance and scalability of a web-based groupware communication application using both non-blockchain and blockchain technologies. Scalability is measured where message load is synthesized over two typical communication topologies. The first is 1 to n network -- a typical client-server or star-topology with a central vertex (server) receiving all messages from the remaining n - 1 vertices (clients). The second is a more naturally occurring scale-free network topology, where multiple communication hubs are distributed throughout the network. System performance is tested with both blockchain and non-blockchain solutions using multiple cloud computing configurations. We analyze the empirical results from each configuration to identify the costs and overhead of blockchain technology.",

This paper evaluates the performance of a voltage controller and an angle droop-based power sharing method for a power system, which is a combination of inverter-based generation units and a synchronous generator. The studied controllers enable 1) accurate power sharing between all inverter-based generation units, 2) terminal voltage regulation by considering the maximum current of renewable generation units, and 3) maintaining frequency of the system at 60 Hz in the steady state independent from communication links. Different simulation case studies are performed in PSCAD/EMTDC software to study the performance of the angle droop-based power sharing algorithm.",

    "title": "Computer Supported Indexing: A History and Evaluation of NASA's MAI System",
    "abstract": "Computer supported indexing systems may be categorized in several ways. One classification scheme refers to them as statistical, syntactic, semantic or knowledge-based. While a system may emphasize one of these aspects, most systems actually combine two or more of these mechanisms to maximize system efficiency. Statistical systems can be based on counts of words or word stems, statistical association, and correlation techniques that assign weights to word locations or provide lexical disambiguation, calculations regarding the likelihood of word co-occurrences, clustering of word stems and transformations, or any other computational method used to identify pertinent terms. If words are counted, the ones of median frequency become candidate index terms. Syntactical systems stress grammar and identify parts of speech. Concepts found in designated grammatical combinations, such as noun phrases, generate the suggested terms. Semantic systems are concerned with the context sensitivity of words in text. The primary goal of this type of indexing is to identify without regard to syntax the subject matter and the context-bearing words in the text being indexed. Knowledge-based systems provide a conceptual network that goes past thesaurus or equivalent relationships to knowing (e.g., in the National Library of Medicine (NLM) system) that because the tibia is part of the leg, a document relating to injuries to the tibia should he indexed to LEG INJURIES, not the broader MeSH term INJURIES, or knowing that the term FEMALE should automatically be added when the term PREGNANCY is assigned, and also that the indexer should be prompted to add either HUMAN or ANIMAL. Another way of categorizing indexing systems is to identify them as producing either assigned- or derived-term indexes.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To summarize the practice of medication consultation service based on the platform of \"Our Pharmacist\",and to provide reference for pharmacists participating in pharmaceutical care. METHODS:The 502 medication consultation service for children,pregnant women and lactating women were collected from the platform of\"Our Pharmacist\"during Oct. 2017-Jul. 2018. General information,main medication,types of drugs,types of questions,types of irrational drug use were analyzed statistically. The practice of rational drug use patient guidance service based on evidence-based concept was introduced with typical examples. RESULTS:Among 502 cases of consultation,147(29.3%)were males and 355(70.7%)were females,and the age was mainly 20-40 years old(291 case,58.0%). The proportions of patients taking 1-2,3-4,5 types or more drugs were 45.4%,41.4% and 13.2%,respectively,and those who took 5 or more drugs at the same time were all children's patients. In respect of medication consultation content,children medication consultation,pregnant medication consultation and lactating medication consultation accounted for 42.0%,40.6%,17.4%,respectively. Antibiotics,Chinese patent medicines and antivirals accounted for the largest proportion of consulting drugs,being 25.6%,17.8%,12.1%,respectively. The question types of medication consultation included indication,dosage and course of treatment,drug safety and ADR,accounting for 31.9%,17.5%,13.6%,respectively. The types of irrational drug use mainly included improper drug selection,repeated drug use and no indication,accounting for 44.1%,21.0%,14.9%,respectively. In typical cases,pharmacists conducted systematic evidence inquiry and answered patient consultation strictly in accordance with the evidence-based concept. The main evidence-based process included formulating retrieval strategies,retrieving relevant literature,strictly evaluating evidence(authenticity,reliability and adaptability),screening evidence according to its evidence level from high to low,evaluating evidence comprehensively and applying it to practice. Medication guidance information provided by pharmacists based on evidence not only corrected the irrational drug use of patients,but also received good feedback from patients. Five-star score accounts for 95.5% of the satisfaction evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: Based on evidence-based concept, the platform of \"Our Pharmacist\" provides medication consultation service,which provides references for pharmacists to carry out targeted pharmaceutical care.",

    "abstract": "Electricity demand of electric railways is a relatively unexplored source of flexibility in demand response applications in power systems. In this paper, we propose a transactive control based optimization framework for coordinating the power grid network and the train network. This is accomplished by coordinating dispatchable distributed energy resources and demand profiles of trains using a two-step optimization. A railway based dynamic market mechanism (rDMM) is proposed for the dispatch of distributed energy resources (DER) in the power network along the electric railway using an iterative negotiation process, and generates profiles of electricity prices, and constitutes the first step. The train dispatch attempts minimize the operational costs of trains that ply along the railway, while subject to constraints on their acceleration profiles, route schedules, and the train dynamics, and generates demand profiles of trains and constitutes the second step. The rDMM seeks to optimize the operational costs of the underlying DERs while ensuring power balance. Together, they form an overall framework that yields the desired transactions between the railway and power grid infrastructures. This overall optimization approach is validated using simulation studies of the Southbound Amtrak service along the Northeast Corridor (NEC) in the United States, which shows a 25% reduction in energy costs when compared to standard trip optimization based on minimum work, and a 75% reduction in energy costs when compared to the train cost calculated using a field dataset.",

    "abstract": "Today the world economy is evolving, phenomenon of Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) between companies have become increasingly frequent. This is because, through the acquisition of companies can achieve an effective combination of resources and complementary advantages, it can provide a shortcut for the enterprises to be bigger and stronger. Today, in the business world, M&A has become an irresistible trend of the world, increasing scale and increasingly wide range of M&A, and accordingly, the amount of M&A is becoming higher and higher. However, many research results have indicated that the majority of M&A is unsuccessful. Pay excessive premiums is one of the factors that can not be ignored. Therefore, the study on M&A premium factors and the influence level of these factors is both theoretical value and practical significance.M&A motivation is the starting point of corporate M&A, companies and managers may initiate acquisitions for different purposes, which may lead to the defeat at the purchase price negotiations, and pay a higher price. This paper will focus on the M&A motivations that can impact premium, so that the companies will avoid these motivations as much as possible in the acquisitions, to improve the efficiency and the success of Mergers and Acquisitions.At first, this paper starts from the M&A motivation, introduces some popular motivations currently, includes motivations of diverse acquisitions to spread risk, seeking synergetic effect, agent motivation, getting the control power to gain binifit for themselvs, pursuing market power and other motivations, theoretically illustrate the relationship between M&A motivation and premium. Secondly, analysis the impact of motivations on M&A premium, then put forward corresponding hypothesis and build a model. Finally, Collect related information and data of M&A events occurred in the Shanghai Stock Exchange between 2010 and 2014, use the method of multiple linear regression to verify the theory of the proposed hypothesis.This paper uses document analysis method, standard research method,and empirical research method, analyzes the effects of Mergers and Acquisitions motivation on premiums. Comes to a conclusion:diversify acquisitions, the size of target company have a negative correlation between M&A premium; the proportion of the top 10 shareholders, get the control power have a positive correlation between M&A premium, that is to say, of the M&A motivations, diversify acquisitions to spread risk, agent motivation, manegement of self-interest motivation and get the control power to gain binifit for themselvs have impacts on M&A premium.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a comparative analysis of some novel approaches proposed by authors for content based image retrieval (CBIR). One of them uses Two-Segments Turning Functions (2STF) and provides searching and retrieval of the multimedia documents within digital collections. Another technique retrieves images computing similarity between wavelet coefficients of querying and preprocessed images. For this purpose the Symlet transform has been used in designed system called Image Retrieval by Neural Network and Wavelet Coefficients RedNeW. However both of approaches operate with low-level characteristics processing color regions, shapes, texture, and they do not provide the analysis of image semantics. In order to improve these systems a novel approach is proposed that combines non-sensitive to spatial variations shape analysis of objects in image with their indexing by textual descriptions as part of semantic Web techniques. In the proposed approach the user\u2019 s textual queries are converted to image features, which are used for images searching, indexing, interpretation, and retrieval. A decision about similarity between retrieved images and user\u2019 s query is taken computing the shape convergence and matching to ontological annotations of objects in image providing in this way definition of the machine-understandable semantics. In order to evaluate the proposed approach the Image Retrieval by Ontological Description of Shapes IRONS system has been designed and tested using some standard domains of images.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A new, very convenient and sensitive \u201cin situ\u201d method has been developed for the determination of the absolute configuration of chiral compounds, which can bind to the axial position of [Rh2(O2CCF3)4] (5) and induce circular dichroism within its electronic absorption bands. The CD spectra of the \u201cin situ\u201d complexes of chiral alcohols, ethers (including epoxides), olefins, and ketons with 5 show up to 5 Cotton effects (A \u2013 E) in the 600 \u2013 300 nm range. This method works well for chiral secondary alcohols and monoolefins. For these compounds tentative rules are proposed, which correlate the absolute stereochemistry with the sign of certain Cotton effects of their complexes. A rule for the sign of band E for alcohols and a quadrant rule for the sign of band C for olefins can be applied. Olefins induce unexpected strong Cotton effects in presence of 5 giving evidence for a relatively stable \u03c0-bond between olefin and rhodium atom.",

A learning module for the classroom was developed to enable students to actively study livestock distribution by analyzing recently collected data from an on-ranch situation. Data were collected at the University of Nebraska\u2019s Barta Brothers Ranch in the Nebraska Sandhills. Six cows (Bos taurus) were fitted with global positioning system (GPS) collars and grazed freely with a herd of cow\u2013calf pairs. Their locations were recorded at 5- or 10-minute intervals during two summer grazing periods in 2003. Following each grazing period, the collars were removed and the data were transferred to a personal computer. A geographic information system (GIS) software program (GRASS) was used for data processing and analyses. A standard digital elevation model of the ranch property was imported into GRASS as the base topographical map. Software tools were used to create animations and present analyzed data in tabular and graphical form. The learning module has two lessons. The first lesson presents the principles of grazing distribution and the second lesson enables the student to analyze the GPS locational data. In analyzing the GPS data, students have numerous options and select the pasture, date(s), hours of the day, and the independent variable (e.g., topographical position or livestock water location) to be included in the analyses. Students can develop hypotheses concerning the relationship between these independent variables and livestock distribution, and test them using the output from the module. Student evaluations indicate that the module is effective in engaging the students as learners and improving their ability to think critically.",

    "abstract": "Current state-of-the-art dual camera-based face liveness detection methods utilize either hand-crafted features, such as disparity, or deep texture features to classify a live face and face Presentation Attack (PA). However, these approaches limit the effectiveness of classifiers, particularly deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to unknown face PA in adverse scenarios. In contrast to these approaches, in this paper, we show that supervising a deep CNN classifier by learning disparity features using the existing CNN layers improves the performance and robustness of CNN to unknown types of face PA. For this purpose, we propose to supervise a CNN classifier by introducing a disparity layer within CNN to learn the dynamic disparity-maps. Subsequently, the rest of the convolutional layers, following the disparity layer, in the CNN are supervised using the learned dynamic disparity-maps for face liveness detection. We further propose a new video-based stereo face anti-spoofing database with various face PA and different imaging qualities. Experiments on the proposed stereo face anti-spoofing database are performed using various test case scenarios. The experimental results indicate that our proposed system shows promising performance and has good generalization ability. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "Publisher Summary The chapter presents the basic techniques used for image processing and pictorial pattern recognition by digital computer. One of the principal goals of image processing is to improve the appearance of the picture by increasing contrast, reducing blur, or removing noise. Methods of doing this are image enhancement or image restoration. Many image processing techniques involve advanced mathematical concepts. The chapter reveals that both image processing and analysis have pictures as input, in the form of arrays of gray levels. This chapter explains a selection of the ideas and methods used in digital image processing and analysis. The chapter provides a nontechnical introduction to some of the basic techniques. Digital image processing and recognition techniques have a broad variety of applications. Image coding is used extensively to reduce the time or bandwidth required for image transmission. Image enhancement and restoration techniques are very helpful in improving the usefulness of images taken near the limits of resolution or under adverse conditions. Pictorial pattern recognition has innumerable applications in document processing such as character recognition; industrial automation such as inspection, and vision-controlled robot assembly; medicine such as hematology, cytology, radiology, and remote sensing, to name only a few of the major areas. The chapter concludes that many of these applications have led to the development of commercial image processing and recognition systems.",

    "abstract": "In order to mitigate the increasingly serious problem of spectrum resource scarcity,dynamic spectrum access has been proposed to utilize the spare spectrum in the cognitive radio network(CRN).The prerequisite of this mechanism is that the secondary user(SU)cannot interfere with the primary network,which introduces new security issues for the CRN.Primary user emulation attack(PUEA)is one kind of typical attacks in the CRN,where the malicious user emulates the characteristics of a primary user(PU)with the purpose of misleading SU(s)to believe that the spectrum band has been occupied and deterring SU(s)from accessing the spare spectrum.Since the PUEA interferes with the CRN,it is necessary to investigate the countermeasures against the PUEA.In this paper,we study the detection techniques against the PUEA based on the channel characteristics.We study the PUEA detection problem with the prior information of the PU,and propose a PUEA detection method based on the multipath delay of the wireless channel.In the proposed method,the multipath delay of the fading channel is utilized as the test statistic.The prior information of the PU's characteristics and the pre-defined detection threshold are used to construct the binary hypothesis test for detecting the PUEA.Moreover,the performance of the proposed detection method in terms of the false positive probability and the false negative probability is analytically evaluated.In addition,we validate the proposed method using the experimental platform built by the universal software radio peripherals.Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed multipath-delay-based PUEA detection method achieves a high detection probability,as well as a low false positive probability.We study the PUEA detection problem without the prior information of the PU and under a variant environment,and propose a PUEA detection method based on the reinforcement learning.First,we define the network models with one PU and multiple PUs scenarios,respectively,and address the workflow of PU(s),SUs and MUs with the reward and punishment mechanism.Then,for two network scenarios,the SUs' reward is analyzed and a Q-learning-based PUEA detection method is proposed.In the proposed method,the multipath-delay is taken as the state,the detection threshold is taken as the action,and the long-term expected profit(the reward feedback to the SU)is taken as the optimization objective,the goal of the proposed method is to find the optimal threshold in different network scenarios.Simulation results show that the Q-learning-based PUEA detection method can adaptively adjust the detection threshold according to the variant environment,which results in a better detection performance,and the detection reward improvement.",

    "title": "An effective approach for high-dimensional reliability analysis of train-bridge vibration systems via the fractional moment",
    "abstract": "The safety and stability performance of train-bridge vibration (TBV) systems become seriously concerned with an increasing operation speed of rails. In this regard, many assessment indicators in the railway specification are defined based on the wheel-rail force and vehicle acceleration. However, mathematical modeling of this dynamic system needs the probability theory to account for uncertain damping/stiffness model parameters and stochastic track irregularities, which result in thousands of input random variables for digital simulations of this stochastic TBV model. This extremely high-dimensional (EHD) input uncertainty poses a major challenge for many well-known structural reliability algorithms. To this end, this paper proposes to use the principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) and the sample-based fractional moment (ME-SFM) for structural reliability analysis of this TBV system. To implement, the reliability performance functions are first defined via the safety and stability criteria in railway specifications, whereas a small number of low-discrepancy samples are used to estimate the fractional moments of a vehicle response quality, e.g. the maximal wheel-rail force and the Sperling ride comfort index that are considered in numerical examples. This sampling nature can ideally overcome the curse of dimensionality of an ordinary structural reliability algorithm. The fractional exponents and Lagrange multipliers used to recover the response distribution are fully optimized through the MaxEnt procedure. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate potential applications of this ME-SFM approach for structural reliability analysis of stochastic train-bridge vibration systems. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

There's some literatures had revealed that P-phenylnapthalene type compounds have anticancer character, but only a little effect had been spent on this field, further more, these literatures didn't describe the QSAR of P-phenylnapthalene type compounds. So we need investigate this type of compounds. The author devised two routes to synthesis a new type of compounds based on p-phenylnapthalene type and evaluated them, also primarily screened their biological activities.\nNitrene is one of the elemental intermediates in organic reactions, which is deficient in electrons but still a actively neutral intermediates. It can be generated in the mild conditions through N-(p-tolylsulfonyl)iminophenyliodinane by transition metal catalysts. Because of the easiness to prepare the material and the mild reaction conditions, it was used in every aspects of nitrene reactions. However, there is rare literatures describe the transition metal catalyzed selective N-imidation of aromatic nitrogen hetercycles' sp~2 hybird N atom. So the study of transition metal catalyzed selective N-imidation of aromatic nitrogen hetercycles' sp~2 hybird N atom to form the product contains N-N bond ylide type structures is a significative work. The products, which have ylide structures are easy to go 1,3-dipolarcycloaddition with benzyne, then form a new compounds based on\u03b2-phenylnapthalene\u2014indazolo[2,3-a]quinoline.\nHerein, six aspects were considered in the catalyzed N-imidation reactions:\u2460Optimization of catalysts;\u2461Confirmation of effect of solvent;\u2462The effect of base;\u2463The effect of reaction time and reaction temperature;\u2464The minimum of ctatlyst loading;\u2465Investigation the extension of substrates.\nIn conclusion, the catalyst 11 can selective N-imidation of aromatic nitrogen hetercycles' sp~2 hybird N atom to form N-N bond ylide structures in high yields under mild conditions. That's in solvent of dichloromethane, 0.5 %(mol) load of catalyst, N_2 protection and under 30\u2103.\nTo further study this type of N-N ylide bond, recur to the Guantum Chemistry software\u2014Gaussian03, the author using the ab initio's HF method at the basis set 6-31g calculated the optimization geometry, bond lengence and bond angle. The results can be used in the explanation why the yield varied from different structures.\nThe primary biological screening showed that maybe get better biological angents through introduction water-solubility group at the position of 6 of indazolo[2,3-a]quinoline.

    "abstract": "Abstract\n                The cohesin complex mediates DNA-DNA interactions both between (sister chromatid cohesion) and within chromosomes (DNA looping) via a process thought to involve entrapment of DNAs within its tripartite ring. It has been suggested that intra- chromosome loops are generated through processive extrusion of DNAs through the lumen of cohesin\u2019s ring. Scc2 (Nipbl) is essential for loading cohesin onto chromosomes but not for maintaining sister chromatid cohesion following DNA replication. It has therefore been assumed that Scc2 is involved exclusively in the cohesin loading process. However, it is possible that the stimulation of cohesin\u2019s ABC-like ATPase by Scc2 also has a post-loading function, for example driving loop extrusion. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and single-molecule tracking, we show that Scc2 binds dynamically to chromatin, principally through an association with cohesin. Scc2\u2019s movement within chromatin is consistent with a \u201cstop-and-go\u201d or \u201chopping\u201d motion. We suggest that a low diffusion coefficient, a low stoichiometry relative to cohesin, and a high affinity for chromosomal cohesin enables Scc2 to move rapidly from one chromosomal cohesin complex to another, performing a function distinct from loading.",

    "title": "The windows 7 build key: redesigning and automating image deployment",
    "abstract": "The image deployment process requires a certain amount of effort, finesse, and luck to effectively execute. Manual techniques are prone to inefficiency and inconsistency, and commercial products necessitate costly software, server-side additions, or network changes; and likely, these tasks must be performed by specialized IT staff. Dwindling resources and increasing demands are compelling IT organizations to do different with less. Technology is changing in the academic community, and IT service units must adapt by concentrating on other, more valuable initiatives. The Windows 7 Build Key (WBK) allows this by replacing the complication and redundancy of image deployment and configuration with a fully unattended procedure that requires only about 5 minutes per machine. A bootable USB-based solution, the WBK is portable, easy, secure, and different from other approaches. Sensitive information like passwords, data, and the image itself are encrypted, allowing student/outsourced staff to build machines without disclosure or technical prerequisites. The WBK also takes the work out of image maintenance: out-of-box software or drivers are a simple drag-and-drop, and configuration is updated inside an XML file---no more finger-crossing with Sysprep. At the end of the build, users have a fresh installation of Windows 7 that is completely configured without any IT intervention. And even better, the computer can be rebuilt later without using the build key. This paper presents a model for designing a zero-cost automated Windows 7 deployment strategy from build to login that doesn't require any changes to the network or large investment of time.",

Different disciplines use schematisation for different reasons. In cartography, graphic schematisation is one aspect of map generalisation. In contrast, cognitive science addresses schematisation as a method to intentionally emphasize certain aspects of knowledge beyond technical necessity; therefore, the notion of schematic map is proposed to denote maps that employ schematisation for cognitive representational reasons. This chapter discusses different views of schematisation from cartography, linguistics, and artificial intelligence. Connections to qualitative reasoning in artificial intelligence are drawn. We address human spatial cognition and present examples of task-oriented representations. Finally, multimodality for conveying spatial knowledge and its application in schematic maps are discussed.",

It involves the usage of mobile devices and cloud computing to perform resource intensive tasks using the internet with minimum impact on cellular resources. Nowadays, people are relying on mobile devices due to their small size and user friendly interface but due to its limited storage capacity, people can no more rely on internal RAM. Therefore, this promotes a drastic need for technology to make it possible for anyone to access their data anywhere anytime. As a result, Mobile Cloud Computing facilitates mobile users with its enticing technology by providing its on-demand and scalable services. But privacy and security are the main concern for a mobile user in the modern era. Thus, issues regarding security can be divided into cloud security and mobile network user\u2019s security, respectively. However, the primary focus of this study is to analyze how to secure the user's data in a mobile cloud.

The distance of wireless communications between buoys is critical for oceanographic monitoring. In this paper, a new technique is presented to improve the distance of marine wireless communication using beamforming. An inertial measurement unit (IMU) which consists of tri-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers is installed on the buoy node to track the realtime attitude of the antenna array. The realtime attitude of the antenna array is calculated with a filter scheme. With the result, the relative direction of the destination node to the antenna array is obtained. Then a corresponding algorithm is selected to control phased array antenna beamforming parameters, directing the beam at the destination node.

Cell surface radiolabeling of both trichomonads by the galactose oxidase/NaB[ 3 H] 4 technique indicated that the glycoconjugate was located on the cell surface of the parasites. The glycoconjugates were extracted from the delipidated residue fraction with the solvent, water/ethanol/diethylether/pyridine/NH 4 OH (15:15:5:1:0.017) and were purified to homogeneity by Sepharose CL-4B followed by octyl-Sepharose chromatography and methanol precipitation. The glycoconjugates migrated as broad bands upon SDS-PAGE. The T. foetus glycoconjugate contained large amounts of fucose along with some mannose, galactose, glucosamine and glucose and trace amounts of galactosamine and inositol. The T. vaginalis glycoconjugate appeared to contain large amounts of glucosamine and galactose along with some glucose, mannose and traces of galactosamine and inositol. The surface-labeled glycoconjugates from both parasites was found to be deaminated with nitrous acid and susceptible to phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, indicating the presence of a phospholipid anchor. Furthermore, these glycoconjugate were found to contain phosphate and were labile to hydrolysis by mild acid, strongly suggesting that the intact molecule is related to Leishmania lipophosphoglycans (LPG). The most striking and the unique features of these glycoconjugate molecules are the presence of large amounts of fucose in T. foetus and glucosamine in T. vaginalis along with the presence of galactosamine in both parasites. These results indicate that these glyconjugates are new types of LPG-like molecules expressed on the trichomonad cell surface and are structurally distinct from Leishmania LPG.",

The gripper is operated by a piezo actuator capable of 18 \u03bc m displacement at 150 V of applied DC voltage. This is then amplified by a factor of 8.1 to a maximum tip displacement of 154 \u03bc m. This is achieved by incorporating bridge and lever amplifying techniques into the design.

    "abstract": "Antibodies play an increasingly important role in both basic research and the pharmaceutical industry. Since their efficiency depends, in ultimate analysis, on their atomic interactions with an antigen, studying such interactions is important to understand how they function and, in the long run, to design new molecules with desired properties. Computational docking, the process of predicting the conformation of a complex from its separated components, is emerging as a fast and affordable technique for the structural characterization of antibody-antigen complexes. In this manuscript, we first describe the different computational strategies for the modeling of antibodies and docking of their complexes, and then predict the binding of two antibodies to the stalk region of influenza hemagglutinin, an important pharmaceutical target. The purpose is two-fold: on a general note, we want to illustrate the advantages and pitfalls of computational docking with a practical example, using different approaches and comparing the results to known experimental structures. On a more specific note, we want to assess if docking can be successful in characterizing the binding to the same influenza epitope of other antibodies with unknown structure, which has practical relevance for pharmaceutical and biological research. The paper clearly shows that some of the computational docking predictions can be very accurate, but the algorithm often fails to discriminate them from inaccurate solutions. It is of paramount importance, therefore, to use rapidly obtained experimental data to validate the computational results.",

    "abstract": "The merging process occurring between humans and the ICT network surrounding them has led to the emergence of several new paradigms in computing. Cognitive infocommunications (CogInfoCom) aims to investigate how cognitive processes can co-evolve with infocommunications devices, irrespective of whether those processes are entirely natural, entirely artificial, or a combination of the two. An important question in CogInfoCom is how communication signals can emerge and evolve naturally between various natural/artificial systems. In this paper, it is argued that the development of new technologies capable of adapting in their communication with users can be informed by research on animal communication. To elaborate this view, the ethological concepts of cues, signals and ritualization are adapted to CogInfoCom. The technological interpretations of these concepts are discussed in terms of design strategies and application examples.",

    "abstract": "LXI, which is generally recognized as the new generation of instrument bus technology, not only has developed rapidly in the field of test and measurement, but also has a vast potential for future development. At present, the LXI trigger requires the clock synchronization precision to reach a sub microsecond level or even higher one. Therefore, in order to meet this accuracy requirement, a scheme based on the embedded Linux and IEEE 1588 protocol is proposed in this paper on the basis of studying LXI so as to realize high accurate clock synchronization. This scheme acquires hardware timestamp by utilizing PHY chip DP83640 and realizes PTP hardware clock driving based on Linux. A synchronization test with Agilent B LXI trigger box under the current condition is conducted and about 100ns of synchronization precision can be reached when connected with cable directly. The result demonstrates the feasibility of the scheme and that the clock synchronization precision can reach a nanosecond level.",

The algorithm runs in O(n(4)) expected time, where n is the number of the corners of the polygon.

On P2P systems using DIs, a peer enables to construct edges to others directly. This network model is based on the small-world models' which have two characteristic parameters, a small average path length and a large clustering coefficient.

    "title": "Incites into Citation Linking using the OAI-PMH",
    "abstract": "There are some 300 repositories of research material (Source: IAR), most of which have an OAI-PMH interface, but no current Institutional Repositories export reference data - nor do they provide their users with citation impact metrics. We propose a model for extending IR's to be citation aware and to expose that data to citation indices using the OAI-PMH and OpenURL. We present some techniques for the export of citation data using the OAI-PMH in Citebase Search.\nAs part of a proposed Open Access Citation Information study we have developed a proposal for the integration of reference parsing and linking into the author- deposit process. This highly-distributed approach to citation linking utilises the OAI-PMH to transfer structured citation data between IRs and citation indexing services.\nOpenURL - a standard for contextual linking using bibliographic data - is now a NISO standard. As well as it's linking role, OpenURL is a useful standard for the transfer of bibliographic data for the purposes of citation indexing. The developing DCMI guidelines for encoding citation metadata makes use of OpenURL context objects in XML. A more lightweight approach is implemented by Citebase Search for transferring bibliographic data using OpenURLs by encoding the metadata as URIs (OpenURL 'KEV' format) and including these in repeated simple Dublin Core relation elements.\nThe widespread adoption of OpenURL for contextual linking and the transfer of citation links will lower the barriers to citation indices as well as enabling novel new interactions between services (e.g. through the embedding of citation analysis services into IRs). Emerging technologies using the OAI-PMH and OpenURL will allow seemless linking across subscription-based and open access services, creating an integrated, citation-linked environment for researchers.",

    "abstract": "Fatigue tests have been made on a SUS 316 stainless steel at 550\u00b0C under stress patterns of intermittent strain wave form which is composed of cycling of a large pulsating strain and superposed small strain cycling. A rest time was 5sec. and it was introduced at zero strain of a large strain cycle.The method of life prediction for the strain cycling was examined on the basis of a linear cumulative damage concept. A linear rule based on the fatigue life curve under a constant strain amplitude gave a reasonable prediction in the case that the superposed small strain was a larger fraction of the basic large pulsating strain, although it gave a poor prediction in the case that the superposed small strain was a small fraction of the latter.By using Manson's 10per cent rule, a reasonable life was predicted regardless the fraction of the superposed small strain to the basic large pulsating strain.",

Though Laplacianfaces method considered the manifold structures of the face images, it has limits to solve face recognition problem. This paper proposes a new feature extraction method, Two Dimensional Laplacian EigenMap (2DLEM), which especially considers the manifold structures of the face images, and extracts the proper features from face image matrix directly by using a linear transformation. As opposed to Laplacianfaces, 2DLEM extracts features directly from 2D images without a vectorization preprocessing. To test 2DLEM and evaluate its performance, a series of experiments are performed on the ORL database and the Yale database. Moreover, several experiments are performed to compare the performance of three 2D methods. The experiments show that 2DLEM achieves the best performance.",

    "abstract": "The glucose transporter type 1 (Glut1) is the most important energy carrier of the brain across the blood-brain barrier. In the early nineties, the first genetic defect of Glut1 was described and known as the Glut1 deficiency syndrome (Glut1-DS). It is characterized by early infantile seizures, developmental delay, microcephaly, and ataxia. Recently, milder variants have also been described. The clinical picture of Glut1 defects and the understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease have significantly grown. A special form of transient movement disorders, the paroxysmal exertion-induced dyskinesia (PED), absence epilepsies particularly with an early onset absence epilepsy (EOAE) and childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), myoclonic astatic epilepsy (MAE), episodic choreoathetosis and spasticity (CSE), and focal epilepsy can be based on a Glut1 defect. Despite the rarity of these diseases, the Glut1 syndromes are of high clinical interest since a very effective therapy, the ketogenic diet, can improve or reverse symptoms especially if it is started as early as possible. The present article summarizes the clinical features of Glut1 syndromes and discusses the underlying genetic mutations, including the available data on functional tests as well as the genotype-phenotype correlations.\nThis article is part of the Special Issue \"Individualized Epilepsy Management: Medicines, Surgery and Beyond\".

By leveraging the sparsity of forced oscillations along with the low-rank nature of synchrophasor data, the problem of source localization under resonance conditions is cast as computing the sparse and low-rank components using Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA), which can be efficiently solved by the exact Augmented Lagrange Multiplier method. Based on this problem formulation, an efficient and practically implementable algorithm is proposed to pinpoint the forced oscillation source during real-time operation. Furthermore, theoretical insights are provided for the efficacy of the proposed approach, by use of physical model-based analysis, specifically by highlighting the low-rank nature of the resonance component matrix.

    "abstract": "Engineering for lifecycle of products integrates all required definitions, descriptions, and simulations in contextual model spaces. Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) is flexible virtual technology to serve this new way of product engineering in company environments. Presently, communication between engineer and PLM modeling environment is done using product object generation processes where human defines features as objects. The well known and proven feature principle has been extended to the entire product model. It was first defined in the ISO10303 product model standard. A PLM system is open for extension by new features, procedures, and human communication surfaces in application environment opening the way also for research. As a contribution to research in open PLM environments, this paper introduces a novel knowledge based and product behavior driven human control of product object definition. Recent product modeling in PLM system handles contextual features including knowledge entities such as rule sets, etc. An actual problem in industrial engineering environments is that model of complex product includes huge number of feature and context definitions making communication of human with object generation very difficult. Contributing to a possible solution, this paper introduces an approach and method to replace the currently applied direct human control of product model object generation processes by a new objective and knowledge driven adaptive control. For this reason, the currently applied product model is proposed to extend by a new contextual chain including human request, product definition objective, product behavior, product object generation control, and product object model representation. The main essence of the proposed modeling is situation based product behavior feature driven definition of product objects as features. Situation connects specified product quality, knowledge for feature definition, and product features for requested product functions.",

The Healthcare IoT (HIoT) provides Hospitals to render excellent services to Patients at an optimized cost. The Healthcare IoT must ensure not to disrupt or tamper with sensitive Medical Information of the Patient in addition to the continuous availability of data and services. The proposed framework is designed for secure emergency access to Patient data over Healthcare IoT. Normally, the Doctor obtains the Shared Key directly from the Patient to access the Medical data.

    "title": "Application of information theory for the analysis of cogeneration-system performance1Published in co-operation with the Japanese Society of Energy Resources1",
    "abstract": "Successful cogeneration system performance depends critically upon the correct estimation of load variation and the accuracy of demand prediction. We need not only aggregated annual heat and electricity demands, but also hourly and monthly patterns in order to evaluate a cogeneration system's performance by computer simulation. These data are usually obtained from the actual measurements of energy demand in existing buildings. However, it is extremely expensive to collect actual energy demand data and store it over a long period for many buildings. Here we face the question of whether it is really necessary to survey hourly demands. This paper provides a sensitivity analysis of the influence of demand-prediction error upon the efficiency of cogeneration systems, so as to evaluate the relative importance of various demand components. These components are annual energy demand, annual heat-to-electricity ratio, daily load factor and so forth. Our approach employs the concept of information theory to construct a mathematical model. This analysis provides an indication of the relative importances of demand indices, and identifies what may become a good measure for assessing the efficiency of the cogeneration system for planning purposes.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Current teaching in pharmacology is passive with less emphasis on clinical application. There is a need to incorporate newer instructional designs into pharmacology. Student-led objective tutorial (SLOT) is one of the novel designs to enhance interest among learners, provide opportunities for group learning, and facilitate self-directed learning. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of SLOTs over conventional tutorials (CTs) in pharmacology and to obtain feedback from the students regarding their perceptions about it. Subjects and Methods: The regular batch of MBBS 2nd professional in pharmacology was randomly divided into two groups. Five topics from central nervous system (CNS) were selected. One group received SLOT as the instructional strategy, whereas the other group went through CTs. At the end of the module, a written test was conducted to assess the effectiveness of both strategies. The students provided feedback regarding their experience using a prevalidated questionnaire. Statistical Analysis: The mean scores of both the groups were analyzed using Mann\u2013Whitney U-test. Results: There was no significant difference in the mean scores of the end of the module test. However, the overall passing percentage was significantly higher in the intervention group (P = 0.043). A total of 45.71% students favored it as a future tutorial method and expressed that SLOT enhanced their ability to learn independently. Conclusion: SLOT is an effective teaching\u2013learning method to teach pharmacology to medical undergraduates. It enhances interest among learners and increases the ability to learn independently. Key message: Student led objective tutorial (SLOT) serve as critical determinants for self-learning and improve analytical skills of students. It enhances interest among learners, provide opportunities for group learning and facilitate self-directed learning. SLOT can be introduced as an interactive teaching learning strategy in pharmacology.",

We propose a new differentially private greedy decision forest algorithm called DPGDF to help improve the accuracy of privacy-preserving data mining. Unlike previous algorithms that only employed greedy decision trees or random forests, our algorithm uses a combination of greedy trees and parallel combination theory to construct a greedy decision forest and coordinate privacy protection and prediction accuracy to achieve the best balance. Combined with smooth sensitivity, the introduction of noise is minimized, making the prediction accuracy of the algorithm notably better than the current state-of-the-art algorithms.

    "abstract": "Abstract : The goal of this research was to theoretically and experimentally investigate the use of computer-generated holograms in the design and fabrication of holographic optical elements (holographic lenses or diffraction optics). Conventional design of holographic lenses had previously been limited to spherical recording beams, and more recently to recording beams formed by conventional optical systems. The utilization of computer-generated holograms in the recording beams allows a completely arbitrary specification of the recording wavefronts in the hologram plane, making possible a hologram lens of higher performance (lower aberrations) than previously possible. We refer to an interferometrically recorded hologram lens having a computer-generated hologram in a recording beam as a computer-originated holographic lens. We studied the basic limitations of computer-generated holograms, and integrated the analysis of computer-generated holograms and computer-originated holographic optical elements into ERIM's holographic optical analysis and design (HOAD) ray-tracing computer program. In addition, we designed, fabricated, and tested an optical system using a computer-generated hologram and a computer-originated holographic lens. (Author)",

Saffron spice has been successfully used as a new ingredient in some Italian or Spanish cheeses, but transference of safranal (the main compound responsible for saffron aroma) during cheesemaking has not yet been studied. In this study, the distribution of safranal in cheese, whey and r equesn (Spanish whey cheese) and the antifungal potential of whey fractions against the mould Penicillium verrucosum were studied. To this end, a duplicate fabrication of cheeses was performed with raw ewe's milk with the addition of 40 mu g safranal.kg(-1) or control milk (no safranal addition). Safranal was more concentrated in cheese and requesn (78.91 and 76.95 mu g.kg(-1), respectively) than in whey and requesn whey (35.19 and 34.64 mu g.kg(-1), respectively). These liquid fractions showed good antifungal properties and inhibited mould with a safranal concentration of around 35 mu g.kg(-1), while a solution of 80 mu g.kg(-1) was required for a standard safranal solution to obtain a similar inhibition. These results reveal that whey has a synergistic effect with safranal in preventing cheese spoilage by moulds, which encourages making full use of this problematic by-product.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a Viterbi-specific 2T gain cell- based embedded DRAM (eDRAM) design for IEEE 802.11n WLAN application. In the proposed Viterbi decoder, refresh operations are completely removed in the eDRAM, by ensuring that the read-after-write period of survivor memory is shorter than the retention time of the gain cell. In order to facilitate the write operation with single-supply voltage, a beneficial read word-line (RWL) coupling technique is proposed. In this work, we also present a reference voltage generation scheme to support single-ended read operation. Thanks to the decoupled read and write structure of the gain cell, the proposed eDRAM can support dual-port operations without large area overhead, thus doubling the bandwidth of memories in the Viterbi decoder. To further reduce the area of the customized Viterbi memory, common redundant hardware between the memory peripheral and computational logics is identified and eliminated without latency overhead.

    "abstract": "When quantum computing becomes a wide-spread commercial reality, Quantum Search Algorithms (QSA) and especially Grover's QSA will inevitably be one of their main applications, constituting their cornerstone. Most of the literature assumes that the quantum circuits are free from decoherence. Practically, decoherence will remain unavoidable as is the Gaussian noise of classic circuits imposed by the Brownian motion of electrons, hence it may have to be mitigated. In this contribution, we investigate the effect of quantum noise on the performance of QSAs, in terms of their success probability as a function of the database size to be searched, when decoherence is modelled by depolarizing channels' deleterious effects imposed on the quantum gates. Moreover, we employ quantum error correction codes for limiting the effects of quantum noise and for correcting quantum flips. More specifically, we demonstrate that, when we search for a single solution in a database having 4096 entries using Grover's QSA at an aggressive depolarizing probability of 10<sup>-3</sup>, the success probability of the search is 0.22 when no quantum coding is used, which is improved to 0.96 when Steane's quantum error correction code is employed. Finally, apart from Steane's code, the employment of Quantum Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (QBCH) codes is also considered.",

Data mining on various joining methods was conducted from any available sources, such as experts from academia and industry, handbooks, and vendors. Collected data was organized in a concept map which is an informal way of representing the data structure. The data were arranged into several categories according to their characteristics which include joinable materials, mechanical and design requirements, geometry, and so on. Common parameters and unique parameters were extracted from deep investigation of the gathered data to create a formalized data structure. A database using a general tree structure was then created to be fed into the advisory system. Searching algorithm using SQL query was implemented to navigate through the database to find the joining methods that match the requirements defined by the user.

A change in indoor particulate level is expressed as a change in total exposure levels, which is then linked with a corresponding change in ambient particulate concentrations before evaluating the associated health benefits. In this study, the development of protocol is illustrated by using a typical office building environment and daily time activity patterns of office occupants in Hong Kong. Our results indicate that some benefit gains for the owners-employers and the society would be anticipated if certain filter set configurations had been adopted. However, the amount of benefit gains for the owners-employers is shown to be increased with the average salary level of employees and the duration of their stay in offices. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Although the previously proposed round-robin algorithms achieves 100% throughput asymptotically under uniform Bernoulli i.i.d. traffic, these algorithms do not have a satisfactory performance under nonuniform traffic. In this paper, we propose a dual round-robin algorithm for a CICQ switch with one-cell crosspoint buffers. With our algorithm, each input arbiter is associated with dual round-robin pointers. Unlike the previously proposed algorithms, the new algorithm has distinctive round-robin pointer updating rules which are efficient to cope with nonuniform traffic patterns. Extensive simulations show that our algorithm achieves nearly 100% throughput and low average delay under uniform and a broad class of nonuniform traffic patterns.",

    "abstract": "The design of real-time control software for a mechatronic system must be effectively integrated with the system hardware in order to achieve useful qualitative benefits beyond basic functionality. The sought-after benefits include: rapid development, flexibility, maintainability, extensively, and reusability. In this work we focus upon the interface between the device drivers and the control software with the aim to properly design this interface to best realize the aforementioned benefits. The results of this fundamental research include the development of an easily manageable set of four C++ object classes following an object-oriented approach to software design. These Universal Mechatronic Objects (UMOs) are applicable to a wide spectrum of actuators including dc motors, stepper motors, and solenoids; and sensors including pressure sensors, microswitches, and encoders. UMOs encapsulate the interface between the electrical subsystem and the control subsystem, providing the control software developer with a powerful abstraction that facilitates the development of hardware-independent control code and providing the electrical subsystem developer with an effective abstraction that facilitates the development of application-independent device drivers. Objects which are intuitively related to hardware components of the mechatronic system can be declared using the UMOs early in the system development process to facilitate the rapid concurrent development of both the electrical and the control subsystems. Our UMOs were developed as part of a project to implement a real-time control system for a z-theta robotic manipulator. The z- theta manipulator is one component of the Minifactory project in the Microdynamic Systems Laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University. The goals of this agile assembly project include the reduction of factory setup and changeover times, plug-and-play type modularity, and the reuse of its components. The application of UMOs to the manipulator software development is shown to be consistent with these goals.",

In Canada, co-infections of <i>Echinococcus canadensis</i> and <i>Echinococcus multilocularis</i> based on genetic characterization have been recently reported in wolves, but not yet in other possible hosts such as coyotes and foxes. In this study, we aimed to develop a quantitative real-time PCR assay to detect <i>E. multilocularis</i> and <i>E. canadensis</i> and estimate the occurrence of co-infections while inferring about the relative abundance of the two parasites within hosts. We tested DNA extracted from aliquots of <i>Echinococcus</i> spp. specimens collected from intestinal tracts of 24 coyote and 16 fox carcasses from Alberta, Canada. We found evidence of co-infections of <i>E. multilocularis</i> and <i>E. canadensis</i> in 11 out of 40 (27%) samples, with 8 out of 24 (33%) in coyote samples and 3 out of 16 (19%) in red fox samples. DNA concentrations were estimated in three samples with Cq values within the range of the standard curve for both parasites; two of them presented higher DNA concentrations of <i>E. multilocularis</i> than <i>E. canadensis</i>. The use of qPCR aided detection of co-infections when morphological discrimination was difficult and quantification of DNA for samples within the standard curve. This is the first molecularly confirmed record of <i>E. canadensis</i> in coyotes and the first evidence of co-infections of <i>E. multilocularis</i> and <i>E. canadensis</i> in coyotes and red foxes.",

    "abstract": "Real-time programmers have to deal with the problem of relating timing constraints associated with source code to sequences of machine instructions. This paper describes an environment to assist users in the specification and analysis of timing constraints. A timing analyzer predicts the best and worst case bounds for these constrained portions of code. A user interface for this timing analyzer was developed to depict whether these constraints were violated or met. A user is allowed to specify timing constraints within the source code of a C program. The user interface also provides three different methods for interactively selecting portions of programs. After each selection the corresponding bounded times, source code lines, and machine instructions are automatically displayed. Users are prevented from only selecting portions of the program for which timing bounds cannot be obtained. In addition, a technique is presented that allows the timing analysis to scale efficiently with complex functions and loops. The result is a user-friendly environment that supports the user specification and analysis of timing constraints at a high (source code) level and retains the accuracy of low (machine code) level analysis.

    "abstract": "Recently, Coherent Optical Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (CO-OFDM) has been seen as a potential candidate for long haul optical transmission. It is due to OFDM technique that was proved as an effective solution for mitigating chromatic dispersion (CD) effects in optical communication systems. However, a very basic drawback of OFDM technique is large peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) problem which requires large scale linear power amplifier and optical external modulator. The large PAPR leads to the increase of nonlinearity of optical fiber which depends on instantaneous signal power. So, the performance of CO-OFDM system is degraded. Several approaches were studied and applied in wireless communication. Among all techniques of PAPR reduction, Selected Mapping (SLM) and Partial Transmit Sequence (PTS) are considered as two better methods because of their distortion less characteristics. It is also known as a kind of scrambling technique. But the efficiency of these algorithms in long haul optical communication application is still an open issue. In this paper, we study both PTS and SLM technique to reduce the influence of optics nonlinear effects. The Simulink simulation results are presented and discussed.",

    "abstract": "This thesis focuses on energy recovery system design and energy integration to improve the energy efficiency of process plants. The objectives of this work are to (a) develop a systematic methodology based on thermodynamic principles to integrate energy intensive processes and (b) develop a mathematical programming based approach using thermodynamics and insight for solving industrial sized HENS problems. A novel energy integration methodology, Energy Level Composite Curves (ELCC), has been developed that is a synergy of Exergy Analysis and Composite Curves. ELCC is a graphical tool which provides the engineer with insights on energy integration and this work represents the first methodological attempt to represent thermal, mechanical and chemical energy in a graphical form similar to composite curves for the thermal integration of energy intensive processes. This method provides physical insight to integrate energy sources with sinks. The methodology is useful as a screening tool, functioning as an idea generator prior to the heat and power integration step. A simple energy targeting algorithm is developed to obtain utility targets. The ELCC was applied to a methanol plant to show the efficacy of the methodology. The Sequential Framework, an iterative and sequential methodology for Heat Exchanger Network Synthesis (HENS), is presented in this thesis. The main objective of the Sequential Framework is to solve industrial size problems. The subtasks of the design process are solved sequentially using Mathematical Programming. There are two main advantages of the methodology. First, the design procedure is, to a large extent, automated while keeping significant user interaction. Second, the subtasks of the framework (MILP and NLP problems) are much easier to solve numerically than the MINLP models that have been suggested for HENS. Application of the Sequential Framework to literature examples showed that the methodology generated solutions with total annualized costs lower than those presented in the literature. The examples showed the efficiency of the Sequential Framework in that even though there a four nested loops in the framework, the \u201cbest\u201d solution is reached within a few iterations. This is primarily due to the capability of the stream match generator to identify superior Heat Load Distributions (HLDs) leading to low total heat transfer area and low Total Annualized Cost. The three sub-problems in the Sequential Framework, minimum number of units (MILP model), stream match generator (\u201cvertical\u201d MILP model) and network generation and optimization (NLP model), are described with details on their formulation. In the minimum number of units sub-problem, it is shown that stream supply temperature are sufficient to define temperature intervals. The importance and role of Exchanger Minimum Approach Temperature (EMAT) in the stream match generator model is shown and motivated the addition of an EMAT loop in the Sequential Framework. One of the limiting factors in the methodology is related to the computational complexity of the two MILP sub-problems where significant improvements are required to prevent combinatorial explosion. To ease this problem for the minimum number of units MILP sub-problem, it is modified to reduce the gap using physical insights and heuristics. Another novel approach tested was to reformulate some parts of the model by use of some ideas from set partitioning problems. Results show that even though both methods succeed in tightening the LP relaxation, the model solution times remain too long to overcome the size in the Sequential Framework. A problem difficulty indicator is explored to identify computationally expensive problems prior to solution. For the stream match generator MILP sub-problem, the model is modified to reduce the gap using physical insights. The objective is changed to include binary variables and priorities were set for these variables. Though these modifications showed improvement in solution time, orders of magnitude improvement are required to solve large models. Another limiting factor in the methodology is that the network generation and optimization sub-problem is formulated as a non-convex NLP leading to local optima. Clever starting value generators based on physical insight were developed to mitigate this issue.",

    "title": "Characterizing and Injecting Faults in Executable Models Specified with fUML",
    "abstract": "Fault Injection (FI) is a well-known system verification technique, in which faults are artificially introduced into a system, to assess its behavior in exceptional conditions. FI can be applied at different levels, including physical, hardware and software. FI has also been applied at model level, although the amount of work in this direction is limited. However, the importance of models in the development of complex systems is growing, pushing towards model-level verification and sim-ulations. The Foundational UML (fUML) is a specific subset of UML, released as an OMG standard, that has a precise execution semantics and can therefore be executed. In this paper we investigate the application of FI to executable models specified with fUML. We first characterize the kind of fault that may be applied to fUML models, and then we realize an injection mechanisms based on automated model transformation. We apply the methodology to a simple example in the space domain, adapted from a real satellite system. We believe this is an important first step for the adoption of FI techniques on fUML models, for an early detection of design flaws. We conclude discussing some challenges and directions for future work.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Cervical cancer is the second most common female malignant tumors.Cervical cancer is divided into adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma. Theincidence of cervical adenocaricinoma is obviously lower than that of cervicalsquamous carcinoma. Cervical adenocarcinoma comprise5%-8%of all cervicalcancers in the former study. But in recent years, research has shown the incidence ofcervical adenocarcinoma tend to be higher. Because of the cervical adenocarcinoma ishard to be found, so its prognosis is much worse than the cervical squamouscarcinoma. The accurate clinical pathological diagnosis of cervical adenocarcinoma isparticularly important to evaluate the prognosis. This experiment mainly investigatesthe expression and their significanceof SCCE and Villin in cervical adenocarcinoma.\nMethods: Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of SCCE, ER,CEA and Vimentin in tissue from45cervical adenocarcinoma,24cervical glandularintraepithelial neoplasia (CGIN) and24normal cervical tissues. Western blottingmethod was used to detect the expression of SCCE and Villin in tissues from10cervical adenocarcinoma and5normal cervical tissues. SPSS16.0statistical packagewas used for statistical analysis of clinical pathology and follow-up data. A P-value of<0.05was considered significant.\nResults:\n1Immunohistochemical staining results\n1.1The expression of SCCE\uff0c Villin in cervical adenocarcinoma, CGIN andnormal cervical tissues\nImmunohistochemical staining showed that: The difference was statisticallysignificant between the expression of SCCE and Villin in cervical adenocarcinoma,CGIN and normal cervical tissues(P<0.05). In cervical adenocarcinoma and CGINgroup the difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05).\n1.2The rank correlation between SCCE and Villin, ER, CEA, Vimentin proteinin cervical adenocarcinoma and the rank correlation between Villin and ER,CEA, Vimentin protein in cervical adenocarcinoma\nThe statistical analysis results of immunohistochemical staining showed that: theexpression of SCCE and Villin in cervical adenocarcinoma was positively correlated(P<0.05); the expression of SCCE and Vimentin in cervical adenocarcinoma wasnegatively correlated (P<0.05); the expression of SCCE and ER in cervicaladenocarcinoma was negatively correlated (P<0.05); the expression of SCCE andCEA in cervical adenocarcinoma was positively correlated (P<0.05); the expressionof Villin and Vimentin in cervical adenocarcinoma was negatively correlated(P<0.05); the expression of Villin and ER in cervical adenocarcinoma was negativelycorrelated (P<0.05); the expression of Villin and CEA in cervical adenocarcinomawas positively correlated (P<0.05).\n1.3The relationship between the expression of SCCE, Villin and theclinicopathological parameters of cervical adenocarcinoma\nThe expression of SCCE and Villin in stage I of cervical adenocarcinoma waslower than that in stage II+III+IV of cervical adenocarcinoma (P<0.05). Theexpression of SCCE and Villin in the well-differentiated cervical adenocarcinomawas lower than that in the moderately and poorly-differentiated cervicaladenocarcinoma(P<0.05). The expression of SCCE, Villin in patients with lymphnode metastasis of cervical adenocarcinoma was higher than that in patients with nolymph node metastasis(P<0.05).\n1.4The multiple factor analysis on prognosis of cervical adenocarcinoma\nCox regression analysis showed that clinical stage, histological grade, lymphnode metastasisand, the expression of SCCE can significantly affect the survival timeof patients with cervical adenocarcinoma(P<0.05).\n1.5The single factor analysis on prognosis of cervical adenocarcinoma\nThe survival time of stage I group, the well-differentiated group, without lymphnode metastasis group and SCCE negative groupwere longer than that of stageII+III+IV group, the moderatedly and poorly-differentiated group, with lymph node metastasis group, SCCE positive group (P<0.05).\n2Western blotting results\nThe expression of SCCE and Villin in of cervical adenocarcinoma wassignificantly higher than that in normal group (P <0.05).\nConclusion:\n1. The expression of SCCE and Villin in normal cervical tissue, CGIN and cervicaladenocarcinoma was gradually increased, in cervical adenocarcinoma, with theincreasing of clinical stage, histological grade and the incidence of lymph nodemetastasis, the expression of SCCE, Villin is gradually increased. So SCCE andVillin may contribute to the occurrence, development and metastasis of cervicaladenocarcinoma.\n2\uff0eSCCE, Villin, ER, CEA and Vimentin joint detection can improve the diagnosticaccuracy of cervical adenocarcinoma.\n3. The expression of SCCE can be used as an independent indicator of judging theprognosis of patients with cervical adenocarcinoma.  ",

The results obtained revealed that lithium-doping resulted in a significant increase in the internal strain and a decrease in lattice parameter. These changes were explained in terms of creation of Ni3+ ions in the doped solids. \u03b3-Irradiation of pure and doped solids effected a decrease in both crystallite size and microstrain upon subjecting to doses of 20 and 30 Mrad. Higher doses induced an increase in both parameters in the case of pure NiO and a further decrease in case of the doped solid. These results were attributed to splitting of the large strained crystallites and to an activated sintering of the small strained ones. \u03b3-Irradiation effected also an increase in the lattice parameters of pure and doped solids due to removal of some excess oxygen with subsequent decrease in the concentration of Ni3+ ions.",

    "abstract": "The tolerance of the spine to bending moments, used for evaluation of injury prevention devices, is often determined through eccentric axial compression experiments using segments of the cadaver spine. Preliminary experiments in our laboratory demonstrated that eccentric axial compression resulted in \"unexpected\" (artifact) moments. The aim of this study was to evaluate the static and dynamic effects of test configuration on bending moments during eccentric axial compression typical in cadaver spine segment testing. Specific objectives were to create dynamic equilibrium equations for the loads measured inferior to the specimen, experimentally verify these equations, and compare moment responses from various test configurations using synthetic (rubber) and human cadaver specimens. The equilibrium equations were verified by performing quasi-static (5 mm/s) and dynamic experiments (0.4 m/s) on a rubber specimen and comparing calculated shear forces and bending moments to those measured using a six-axis load cell. Moment responses were compared for hinge joint, linear slider and hinge joint, and roller joint configurations tested at quasi-static and dynamic rates. Calculated shear force and bending moment curves had similar shapes to those measured. Calculated values in the first local minima differed from those measured by 3% and 15%, respectively, in the dynamic test, and these occurred within 1.5 ms of those measured. In the rubber specimen experiments, for the hinge joint (translation constrained), quasi-static and dynamic posterior eccentric compression resulted in flexion (unexpected) moments. For the slider and hinge joints and the roller joints (translation unconstrained), extension (\"expected\") moments were measured quasi-statically and initial flexion (unexpected) moments were measured dynamically. In the cadaver experiments with roller joints, anterior and posterior eccentricities resulted in extension moments, which were unexpected and expected, for those configurations, respectively. The unexpected moments were due to the inertia of the superior mounting structures. This study has shown that eccentric axial compression produces unexpected moments due to translation constraints at all loading rates and due to the inertia of the superior mounting structures in dynamic experiments. It may be incorrect to assume that bending moments are equal to the product of compression force and eccentricity, particularly where the test configuration involves translational constraints and where the experiments are dynamic. In order to reduce inertial moment artifacts, the mass, and moment of inertia of any loading jig structures that rotate with the specimen should be minimized. Also, the distance between these structures and the load cell should be reduced.",

    "title": "Security Architecture and Protocol for Trust Verifications Regarding the Integrity of Files Stored in Cloud Services \u2020",
    "abstract": "Cloud computing is considered an interesting paradigm due to its scalability, availability and virtually unlimited storage capacity. However, it is challenging to organize a cloud storage service (CSS) that is safe from the client point-of-view and to implement this CSS in public clouds since it is not advisable to blindly consider this configuration as fully trustworthy. Ideally, owners of large amounts of data should trust their data to be in the cloud for a long period of time, without the burden of keeping copies of the original data, nor of accessing the whole content for verifications regarding data preservation. Due to these requirements, integrity, availability, privacy and trust are still challenging issues for the adoption of cloud storage services, especially when losing or leaking information can bring significant damage, be it legal or business-related. With such concerns in mind, this paper proposes an architecture for periodically monitoring both the information stored in the cloud and the service provider behavior. The architecture operates with a proposed protocol based on trust and encryption concepts to ensure cloud data integrity without compromising confidentiality and without overloading storage services. Extensive tests and simulations of the proposed architecture and protocol validate their functional behavior and performance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract : The goal of this research program was to discover and develop real-time neural architectures capable of autonomously carrying out image processing and pattern recognition tasks in environments wherein noisy and unexpected events can occur. Such architectures are needed to cope with the fact that, in naturally occurring scenes, edges, texture, shading, size, stereo, and motion information are often overlaid and are viewed under variable illumination conditions. Special-purpose vision algorithms that can process only one of these types of information do not function well under naturally occurring conditions. The present work has analyzed a large body of data from visual psychophysics and neurobiology in order to discover and test neural principles and mechanisms whereby such a general-purpose competence is achieved by humans and animals. These designs are embodied in multi-level neural networks which are defined by novel types of nonlinear dynamical systems. The networks are computationally characterized for use both in explaining biological data about vision and pattern recognition, and in implementing novel image processing circuits for use in technological applications. Predictions of the theory have also been successfully tested in our psychophysics laboratory.",

    "title": "Optical Fiber Low Coherence Interferometry for Absolute Measurement Without Scanning Action",
    "abstract": "This paper proposed an optical fiber low coherence interferometry for absolute measurement without scanning action. In the process of measurement, the information of the measurand is obtained with a fiber Michelson interferometer which is sourced by a broadband light source with center wavelength of 850nm and spectral width of 44.16nm. The broadband spectrum interferometric beam is dispersed with a bulk dispersing grating to be an optical plate in which the wavelengths are continuously distributed. The optical plate is detected with a linear array charge coupled device (CCD). By transforming the wavelength spectrum of the interferometric signal into wavenumber spectrum, absolute optical path difference of the interferometer can be measured precisely by measuring the wavenumber difference between two neighboring peaks of the wavenumber spectrum. Therefore, high precision absolute measurement of physical quantities can be realized by using this measurement system. Unlike the normal low coherence interferometric measurement systems (LCIMS) which have to scan the optical path difference (OPD) of the interferometer or the wavelength of light source in order to demodulate the measurand, there is no need of scanning action during the measurement procedure, which not only simplifies the measurement system but also improves the measurement speed greatly. A fiber Bragg grating (FBG) in the measurement system is employed to produce a feedback signal in a feedback control circuit which is used to stabilize the optical path difference of Michelson interferometer. By using this feedback control circuit, the environmental disturbances are depressed and high measurement precision is obtained, and the system can be suitable for online measurement. The measurement resolution is as high as 6.03nm. A step height with the calibrated value of 50\u03bcm which is configurated with two gauge blocks is measured by the system. The standard deviation of 10 times measurement results is 6.8nm.Based on the above work, the thesis also presented an improved measurement system by replacing the optical fiber Michelson interferometer with an optical fiber F-P interferometer which is packaged with a pipe and used as a sensor head which can solve the unnecessary measurement errors of the above measurement system when determining the position of peaks of the wavenumber spectrum. The simulation study of the improved measurement system by MATLAB is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Social work as an applied discipline is rapidly developing in our country. The urgency and importance of social work practice has become an important topic in social work education. In order to alleviate the problem of social work internship resources, social work educators began to explore new solutions. Many scholars have pointed the way that universities work with the service programs, so social work students can practice in the service program. As the social work professionalization and specialization in our country has not yet reached a certain level, this practice model is very popular in universities.The researchers found that program-based practice are reasonable, but there are still many risks. In this paper, the researcher chooses one representative practice program as a study case to collect and analyze data, and then come to the following main conclusions.First, project-based practice has its own rationality under the real situation of China.This project-based practice is helpful to students' professional growth and at the same time has positive impact on clients. In the real situation of China, this practice mode will continue.Secondly, ethical risks in project-based practice cannot be ignored. On the one hand, the program is not in line with students' study as the top priority and is contrary to the nature of professional practice as well affects students' learning effect. On the other hand, to provide professional services directly from the intern will take the potential risk to the clients.Thirdly, the reasons for the ethical dilemmas are multifaceted: The interns' professional competence and authority are disproportionate with clients' plight; The specification of program services and student practice are not clear; The roles of intern are unclear and supervisors' supervisory functions are not significant.Finally, the researcher tables the proposals to avoid ethical risks: Develop a detailed project specifications and student 'practice requirements; Promptly follow up training; Improve the supervision mechanism.",

Comparing to six published methods used by the PCAWG Drivers and Functional Interpretation Group, DriverPower has the highest F1-score for both coding and non-coding driver discovery.

In the multiple-input-multiple-output case, when a very large system is considered, one major issue is the overall system complexity. Here, we propose an iterative detection and decoding scheme for the uplink of coded multiple-input-multiple-output systems that replaces the exponential complexity maximum a posteriori detector by an approximate maximum a posteriori low-complexity detector that uses a simple hard-output inner detector at the first iteration followed by parallel interference cancelation and filtering matched to the channel coefficient matrix that is estimated with the aid of orthogonal pilot transmission. From the second iteration onward, the inner hard-output detector is replaced by the results from the previous iteration. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy presents good bit-error-rate performance with low computational complexity, measured by the average number of floating-point operations per message bit.",

Comparing with RED algorithm, although the PI (Proportional-Integral) or PID(Proportional-Integral-Differential) controller for AQM improves the stability, It is very difficulty in selecting a group of optimal parameters for these controller to guarantee the transient performance. Moreover, the case is much worse especially when the networks parameters are time-varying, i.e. time-varying numbers of the users, uncertain link utilization and heterogeneous delays with different users. In this paper, we use numerical optimization to propose an optimal PID (OPID) controller of AQM for TCP with ECN to improve the robustness and transient performance of the PID controller.

    "abstract": "Melanin is a pigment that contributes to skin and causes the physiological pigmentation of gingiva. Excess melanin causes hyperpigmentation. It can affect the appearance and self-esteem of the patients. Gingival hyperpigmentation can be treated by several treatment modalities. Repigmentation occurs post-surgery regardless of the procedure used, but the intensity and degree vary. In spite of recurrence, depigmentation procedures can result in improved gingival appearance. In the present case, the patient complained of black gums. On examination, hyperpigmented gingiva with short clinical crown and aberrant frenal attachment with midline diastema were noted. It was treated by surgical depigmentation, gingivectomy to increase the crown length and frenectomy to correct aberrant frenal attachment. The patient did not agree for midline diastema closure. Gingival pigmentation index was used to grade gingival pigmentation. The gingival aesthetics improved at the end of 5 months.",

However, patients under 45\u00a0years have been shown to exhibit a higher incidence of PDPH, even with small needles.\nQUESTIONS/PURPOSES: This study aimed to estimate the incidence of PDPH from a 27G pencil-point needle in ambulatory surgery patients between the ages of 15-45\u00a0years and compare incidence of PDPH by age group, sex, and history of headache.\nMETHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 300 patients (15-45\u00a0years old) who underwent simple knee arthroscopy under spinal anesthesia with a 27G pencil-point needle were enrolled. Verbal consent was obtained during the initial phone conversation between post-operative days (PODs) 2-5. A PDPH questionnaire was administered during this conversation and between PODs 7-10. Patients who reported a positional headache were contacted by a physician co-investigator, who determined PDPH diagnosis.\nRESULTS: Five patients were excluded from analysis due to complicated operative procedures or spinal needle size. The overall PDPH incidence was 2.0% (95% CI 0.9-4.4; 6/295). PDPH incidence in 15-19-year-old patients was 16.7% (95% CI 4.7-44.8; 2/12). The crude relative risk of PDPH was 15.4 (95% CI 2.8-114.4) for patients with and without history of headache and 2.5 (95% CI 0.5-14.8) for females vs. males. Overall, 16.3% (95% CI 12.5-20.9) of patients reported post-operative, non-positional headaches.\nCONCLUSIONS: There was a low overall incidence of PDPH among patients aged 15-45. Pre-planned subgroup analyses of PDPH incidence by age group revealed a high risk of PDPH among a small sample of 15-19-year-olds.",

The symmetric key based systems usually have some weaknesses such as suffering brute force, de-synchronization, impersonation, and tracing attacks. In addition, the asymmetric key based systems usually suffer from impersonation, man-in-the-middle, physical, and tracing attacks. To get rid of those weaknesses and reduce the system workload, we adopt elliptic curve cryptosystem (ECC) to construct an asymmetric key based RFID authentication system. Our scheme needs only two passes and can resist various kinds of attacks. It not only outperforms the other RFID schemes having the same security level but also is the most efficient.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: To describe a formula to back-calculate the theoretical position of the principal object plane of an intraocular lens (IOL), as well as the theoretical anatomic position in a thick lens eye model. A study was conducted to ascertain the impact of variations in design and IOL power, on the refractive outcomes of cataract surgery.\nMethods: A schematic eye model was designed and manipulated to reflect changes in the anterior and posterior radii of an IOL, while keeping the central thickness and paraxial powers static. Modifications of the shape factor (X) of the IOL affects the thick lens estimated effective lens position (ELP). Corresponding postoperative spherical equivalent (SE) were computed for different IOL powers (-5 diopters [D], 5 D, 15 D, 25 D, and 35 D) with X ranging from -1 to +1 by 0.1.\nResults: The impact of the thick lens estimated effective lens position shift on postoperative refraction was highly dependent on the optical power of the IOL and its thickness. Design modifications could theoretically induce postoperative refraction variations between approximately 0.50 and 3.0 D, for implant powers ranging from 15 D to 35 D.\nConclusions: This work could be of interest for researchers involved in the design of IOL power calculation formulas. The importance of IOL geometry in refractive outcomes, especially for short eyes, should challenge the fact that these data are not usually published by IOL manufacturers.\nTranslational Relevance: The back-calculation of the estimated effective lens position is central to intraocular lens calculation formulas, especially for artificial intelligence-based optical formulas, where the algorithm can be trained to predict this value.",

However, when these annotations are done in real-time and overlaid in the video, their context can be lost due to changes in the scene being annotated. We propose an approach towards maintaining the annotations' context, by using object tracking to create anchors onto which further annotations can be attached. To this end, the annotator is capable of using different tracking methods, including a Kinect sensor and/or the TLD object tracking algorithm. The challenges involved in designing an interface to support the association of video annotations with tracked objects in real-time are also discussed. In particular, we discuss our alternative approaches to handle moving object selection on live video, which we have called \"Hold and Overlay\" and \"Hold and Speed Up\".

    "abstract": "This study was aimed to explore the expression and significance of DNMT1 gene in bone marrow of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The expression of DNMT1 gene was detected by real-time PCR in 30 healthy people and 126 AML patients. The results showed that the expression level of DNMT1 gene was lower in the 30 healthy people and was higher in AML patients. There was a marked decline in the expression level of DNMT1 gene after complete remission (CR) as compared with the initial treatment. The expression level of DNMT1 gene did not correlated with age, sex and the clinical characteristics at initial diagnosis such as white blood cell count and chromosomal karyotype in AML patients. The CR rate in AML patients with low expression level of DNMT1 gene was lower than that in those with high expression level. It is concluded that bone marrow DNMT1 gene level may play an important role in AML pathogenesis and can serve as an index in evaluating AML prognosis.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new type of lattice shell composed of six-bar tetrahedral units whose projections are quadrilateral. The industrialized production and prefabricated construction can be easily carried out for this lattice shell due to its simple and regular form. Though the shell has relatively fewer members and joints and some members in the grids have been removed, the structure can still perform like a double-layer lattice shell. The basic and reinforced structures are given. Four calculation models are established with different joint arrangement patterns and member properties. The joints can take various forms in the models, including rigid joint, semi-rigid-semi-hinged joint and hinged joint, which will result in divergent stiffness and stability performances of the structure. The static characteristics of the lattice shell under vertical load are analyzed, from which the distribution of the internal forces and the displacements of the basic and reinforced structures with four joint arrangement patterns can be gained. The results can provide some guides to the engineering design and selection of structural patterns.",

Physically based image synthesis methods, a research direction in computer graphics (CG), are capable of simulating optical measuring systems in their entirety and thus constitute an interesting approach for the development, simulation, optimization, and validation of such systems. In addition, other CG methods, so-called procedural modeling techniques, can be used to quickly generate large sets of virtual samples and scenes thereof that comprise the same variety as physical testing objects and real scenes (e.g., if digitized sample data are not available or difficult to acquire). Appropriate image synthesis (rendering) techniques result in a realistic image formation for the virtual scenes, considering light sources, material, complex lens systems, and sensor properties, and can be used to evaluate and improve complex measuring systems and automated optical inspection (AOI) systems independent of a physical realization. In this paper, we provide an overview of suitable image synthesis methods and their characteristics, we discuss the challenges for the design and specification of a given measuring situation in order to allow for a reliable simulation and validation, and we describe an image generation pipeline suitable for the evaluation and optimization of measuring and AOI systems.",

One of the drawbacks of this approach is that it separates ontology definition (in ontology editors) from instance editing (in knowledge-acquisition tools). Because many application tasks require ontology definition by domain experts, we have experimented with extending the Protege framework to generate ontology editors in addition to knowledgeacquisition tools for instances.

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to review the published research works on control strategies of stored product pests. Also, to shed light on alternative environmentally friendly methods to protect stored products from pests attack for healthy food safe. The most promising technique that has been developed and continues to be refined, is monitoring populations with insect pheromones and/or food attractants for detecting stored-product insects. Visual and secondary olfactory cues may be necessary for increased the catch of insects in traps. Near Infrared Spectroscopy was used for the classification of insect species, detection of internal insect pests of wheat (infested or uninfested wheat kernels) and distinguishing between unparasitized weevil larvae in wheat and those parasitized by wasps. It may be possible to use electronic nose systems to try and distinguish between grain colonized by mycotoxigenic and non-mycotoxigenic species and this area needs further investigation. The main advantage of using inert dusts is that they are non-toxic to humans and animals. Inert dusts in stored grain can provide continuous protection from insect infestations and do not affect the baking quality of wheat. Ozone is safe to the environment when used for fumigation. Active research is going on to exploit ozone as a potential quarantine treatment for controlling stored-product pests. Natural compounds from plant sources may have the advantage over conventional fumigants in terms of low mammalian toxicity (not true in all cases), rapid degradation and local availability. Compounds of plant origin can be used only for small-scale applications or for space treatments. Validation studies will be necessary to fully determine the potential for biological controls as replacements for insecticidal protectants, Good hygiene in the grain store or storage depot is important in maintaining grain and seed quality. Computer-based decision support systems that use biological and environmental data to predict population trends and evaluate the need for insecticidal inputs have been developed for stored-product storage systems in several countries. As more of these expert systems are developed management decisions may shift to computer-based pest management.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional structure-based localization aims to estimate the six-DOF camera pose of a query image by means of feature matches against a 3D Structure-from-Motion (SfM) point cloud. For city-scale SfM point clouds with tens of millions of points, it becomes more and more difficult to disambiguate matches. Therefore, a 3D structure-based localization method, which can efficiently handle matches with very large outlier ratios, is needed. We propose a two-stage outlier filtering framework for city-scale localization that leverages both visibility and geometry intrinsics of the SfM point clouds. First, we propose a visibility-based outlier filter, which is based on a bipartite visibility graph, to filter outliers on a coarse level. Second, we apply a geometry-based outlier filter to generate a set of fine-grained matches with a novel data-driven geometrical constraint for efficient inlier evaluation. The proposed two-stage outlier filtering framework only relies on the intrinsic information of the SfM point cloud. It is thus widely applicable to be embedded into the existing localization approaches. The experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage outlier filtering framework for city-scale localization.",

In this study, we investigated the change in the cell surface area and protein content of cultured rat cardiomyocytes on exposure to cardiotrophin-1 (Cr-1), a cytokine involved in the growth and survival of cardiac cells, plus SIM, and thus confirmed that SIM ameliorated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by CT-1. We also showed that SIM attenuated cardiac hypertrophy in rats with pressure overload due to abdominal aortic constriction by measuring such parameters as systolic blood pressure, ratio of heart weight to body weight and ratio of left ventricular weight to body weight in rats as well as cross-sectional area of cardiomyocytes. Western blot analysis indicated that the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription UAK/STAT) pathway was involved in the mechanisms underlying the in vitro and in vivo inhibitory effects of SIM on cardiac hypertrophy. Moreover, the effect of SIM amelioration on CT-1-induced cultured cardiomyocyte hypertrophy might be related to the change in angiotensinogen (AGT) mRNA expression, as evidenced by RT-PCR analysis, and the subsequent alteration in angiotensin II (Ang II) levels.

    "abstract": "With the development of mobile communication network technology, the network scale is expanding, the network complexity is also improved. Once the network fails, it will cause a series of devices to generate numerous alarms. Therefore, it is particularly important to accurately predict the alarms, which can prevent the upcoming network alarms in advance or take other measures to reduce losses. Traditional network diagnosis mainly depends on network administrators, which has many subjective factors and low efficiency, and needs to train experienced technicians, which leads to long cycle and high cost. In addition, the manual method is difficult to use a large amount of historical data. In order to solve the problem of network alarm prediction more intelligently, data mining technology is an effective solution, which can mine valuable information from a large number of historical network alarm data. In this paper, combined with the actual network alarm log data of operators and considering the time correlation of alarms, a two-class network alarm prediction (LAB-NAP) algorithm based on LSTM and association algorithm is proposed, which adopts the method of combining LSTM-based two-class model with network alarm association mode. The LAB-NAP algorithm is compared with LSTM-based two-class network alarm prediction (LB-NAP) algorithm and LM-NAP, and the performance of three network alarm prediction modeling methods on the same data set is compared. It is verified that the LAB-NAP method proposed in this paper balances the prediction effect and training time in the large-scale dataset.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing number of electronic resources and library resources, the majority of teachers and students are facing enormous problems and challenges. It becomes time-consuming and laborious to find resources that correspond with interest from the vast collection of digital resources and library books. University Library Management Information System can alleviate this problem to some extent by providing readers with a search function. However, with the acceleration of social and information exchange, teachers'and students'reading scope are widened and the readers show a growing demand for personalization and diversification. Currently university library system has to make appropriate decisions to address this phenomenon and meet the needs of individual users by actively providing books recommendation services. Based on these above, in this thesis, we research university library personalized service system based on data mining techniques.In this thesis, we used SAS Enterpreise Miner to analyze the book inventory data and book lending data from university library. Through statistical analysis of the book inventory data, we obtained the numbers of library books distributed in different categories. Through the analysis of loan data, we found very different loan amounts and periods in different categories of books, and there is a very big difference in teachers' and students'borrow preferences. Based on the interpretation of these information, we can provide useful rules knowledge for library management and support to provide better service for readers.In this thesis, through the demand analysis and detailed design of library personalized service system, we partitioned the system function into modules. This system consists of two main modules, i.e. the administrator module and the user module. Administrator module is mainly responsible for the procurement of books, cataloging, storage, distribution (borrow, return), the reader management, as well as reading room management. General user module includes browsing books, borrowing books and returning books etc. The system also includes a book recommendation function, we recommend books to readers by using collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm based on their historical information. At last, based on J2EE development framework and Struts2.0+Hibernate+Spring mode, we implement a library information management system on Tomcat+Oracle9i development platform. By testing the system, it is found that the system includes the basic library system functions and the business logic is correct. The system is easy to operate and maintenance and has a friendly interface and so on.",

    "abstract": "For the past two decades, there has been an ongoing research effort at Los Alamos National Laboratory to learn more\nabout the Earth\u2019s radiofrequency (RF) background utilizing satellite-based RF observations of terrestrial lightning. The\nFast On-orbit Recording of Transient Events (FORTE) satellite provided a rich RF lighting database, comprising of five\nyears of data recorded from its two RF payloads. While some classification work has been done previously on the\nFORTE RF database, application of modern pattern recognition techniques may advance lightning research in the\nscientific community and potentially improve on-orbit processing and event discrimination capabilities for future\nsatellite payloads. We now develop and implement new event classification capability on the FORTE database using\nstate-of-the-art adaptive signal processing combined with compressive sensing and machine learning techniques. The\nfocus of our work is improved feature extraction using sparse representations in learned dictionaries. Conventional\nlocalized data representations for RF transients using analytical dictionaries, such as a short-time Fourier basis or\nwavelets, can be suitable for analyzing some types of signals, but not others. Instead, we learn RF dictionaries directly\nfrom data, without relying on analytical constraints or additional knowledge about the signal characteristics, using\nseveral established machine learning algorithms. Sparse classification features are extracted via matching pursuit search\nover the learned dictionaries, and used in conjunction with a statistical classifier to distinguish between lightning types.\nWe present preliminary results of our work and discuss classification scenarios and future development.",

In a traditional fat\u2010tree, k\u2010ary n\u2010tree for instance, the degree of root switches is less than that of other switches. Fat\u2010tree is a folded version of a Clos network. A Clos network uses the same degree switches in all stages. However, fat\u2010tree or Clos network has a high switch cost and great packet latency. This paper introduces a Mirrored K\u2010Ary N\u2010Tree (MiKANT) network and presents switch fault\u2010tolerant routing algorithms for it. Compared with k\u2010ary n\u2010trees and Clos networks, MiKANT connects more compute nodes with fewer switches and links so that it can be implemented at a lower hardware cost, it uses switches that have the same number of ports to keep the regularity, and it shortens the average distance to reduce the packet latency for achieving higher communication performance. We give three simple deadlock\u2010free switch fault\u2010tolerant routing algorithms for MiKANT and evaluate their performance. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithms achieve much higher performance than the shortest path routing algorithm.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a detailed study of average reward reinforcement learning, an undiscounted optimality framework that is more appropriate for cyclical tasks than the much better studied discounted framework. A wide spectrum of average reward algorithms are described, ranging from synchronous dynamic programming methods to several (provably convergent) asynchronous algorithms from optimal control and learning automata. A general sensitive discount optimality metric called n-discount-optimality is introduced, and used to compare the various algorithms. The overview identifies a key similarity across several asynchronous algorithms that is crucial to their convergence, namely independent estimation of the average reward and the relative values. The overview also uncovers a surprising limitation shared by the different algorithms: while several algorithms can provably generate gain-optimal policies that maximize average reward, none of them can reliably filter these to produce bias-optimal (or T-optimal) policies that also maximize the finite reward to absorbing goal states. This paper also presents a detailed empirical study of R-learning, an average reward reinforcement learning method, using two empirical testbeds: a stochastic grid world domain and a simulated robot environment. A detailed sensitivity analysis of R-learning is carried out to test its dependence on learning rates and exploration levels. The results suggest that R-learning is quite sensitive to exploration strategies, and can fall into sub-optimal limit cycles. The performance of R-learning is also compared with that of Q-learning, the best studied discounted RL method. Here, the results suggest that R-learning can be fine-tuned to give better performance than Q-learning in both domains.",

The main cause of this omission seems to be rooted in the inexistence of a legal concept of science, which is necessary to delimit the form and content of scientific evidence. Only in American jurisprudence can certain criteria be found to determine the scientificity of the evidence.

The convergent evolution of self-fertilization in three Caenorhabditis species provides a powerful lens to examine causes and consequences of mating system transitions. Among the selfers, C. tropicalis is the least genetically diverse and most afflicted by outbreeding depression. We generated a chromosomal-scale genome for C. tropicalis and surveyed global diversity. Population structure is very strong, and islands of extreme divergence punctuate a genomic background that is highly homogeneous around the globe. Outbreeding depression in the laboratory is caused largely by multiple gene drive elements, genetically consistent with maternal toxin/zygotic antidote systems. Driver loci harbor novel and duplicated genes, and their activity is modified by mito-nuclear background. Segregating drivers dramatically reduce fitness, and simulations show that selfing limits their spread. Frequent selfing in C. tropicalis may therefore be a strategy to avoid drive-mediated outbreeding depression. ",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle can adapt to increased mechanical loads by undergoing hypertrophy. Transient reductions in whole muscle force production have been reported during the onset of hypertrophy, but contractile changes in individual muscle fibers have not been previously studied. Additionally, the extracellular matrix (ECM) stores and transmits forces from muscle fibers to tendons and bones, and determining how the ECM changes during hypertrophy is important in understanding the adaptation of muscle tissue to mechanical loading. Using the synergist ablation model, we sought to measure changes in muscle fiber contractility, collagen content, and cross-linking, and in the expression of several genes and activation of signaling proteins that regulate critical components of myogenesis and ECM synthesis and remodeling during muscle hypertrophy. Tissues were harvested 3, 7, and 28 days after induction of hypertrophy, and nonoverloaded rats served as controls. Muscle fiber specific force (sF<sub>o</sub>), which is the maximum isometric force normalized to cross-sectional area, was reduced 3 and 7 days after the onset of mechanical overload, but returned to control levels by 28 days. Collagen abundance displayed a similar pattern of change. Nearly a quarter of the transcriptome changed over the course of overload, as well as the activation of signaling pathways related to hypertrophy and atrophy. Overall, this study provides insight into fundamental mechanisms of muscle and ECM growth, and indicates that although muscle fibers appear to have completed remodeling and regeneration 1 mo after synergist ablation, the ECM continues to be actively remodeling at this time point.<b>NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY</b> This study utilized a rat synergist ablation model to integrate changes in single muscle fiber contractility, extracellular matrix composition, activation of important signaling pathways in muscle adaption, and corresponding changes in the muscle transcriptome to provide novel insight into the basic biological mechanisms of muscle fiber hypertrophy.",

Here, we outline the UAL theory and discuss the constraints and affordances that seem necessary for constructing an AI machine exhibiting UAL.\u00a0We argue that a machine that is capable of domain-general learning requires the dynamics of a UAL architecture and that a UAL architecture requires, in turn, that the machine is highly sensitive to the environment and has an ultimate value (like self-persistence) that provides shared context to all its behaviors and learning outputs. The implementation of UAL in a machine may require that it is made of \u201csoft\u201d materials, which are sensitive to a large range of environmental conditions, and that it undergoes sequential morphological and behavioral co-development.

Roughly, a recursive graph is a finite set of finite state graphs, which are used in a recursive manner. A recursive graph covers the essential features of both standard devices: It describes the syntactical structure as grammars do, and it represents a method for recognition and parsing as push-down automata do. A notion ofk-determinacy is introduced for recursive graphs and for a restricted kind of them, called simple recursive graphs. Thek-deterministic simple recursive graphs are more general thanLL (k) grammars [5] with respect to parsing-power, but equal with respect to language generation power. The more generalk-deterministic recursive graphs cannot parse the full set ofLR (k)-grammars [4], but they can recognize the full set ofLR (k)-languages.

It is based on NIH/3T3 fibroblast cell line stably expressing fusion fluorescently tagged proteins mCherry-vinculin and GFP-tensin as quantifiable markers for assessment not only of focal but also of fibrillar contacts. Four measurable parameters - spreading, polarization and development of focal and fibrillar adhesions were used to standardize the adhesion of biosensor cells after plating on five substrates of natural origin - fibronectin, vitronectin, laminin-111, laminin-521 and collagen type I. The obtained set of values (adhesion quality map) were utilized to describe the default biosensor behavior and as a standard for evaluation of surface biocompatibility of materials with unknown adhesive properties. To demonstrate the applicability of the biosensor we studied two PDMS-based artificial materials. The results demonstrated the superior adhesive properties of the poly(acrylic acid)-containing polymer (PDMS-PAA) over that of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) copolymer (PDMS-PVP), and pointed out the formation of focal adhesions as a parameter for possible further improvements.

    "abstract": "Time-restricted feeding (TRF, animal-based studies) and time-restricted eating (TRE, humans) are an emerging behavioral intervention approach based on the understanding of the role of circadian rhythms in physiology and metabolism. In this approach, all calorie intake is restricted within a consistent interval of less than 12 hours without overtly attempting to reduce calories. This article will summarize the origin of TRF/TRE starting with concept of circadian rhythms and the role of chronic circadian rhythm disruption in increasing the risk for chronic metabolic diseases. Circadian rhythms are usually perceived as the sleep-wake cycle and dependent rhythms arising from the central nervous system. However, the recent discovery of circadian rhythms in peripheral organs and the plasticity of these rhythms in response to changes in nutrition availability raised the possibility that adopting a consistent daily short window of feeding can sustain robust circadian rhythm. Preclinical animal studies have demonstrated proof of concept and identified potential mechanisms driving TRF-related benefits. Pilot human intervention studies have reported promising results in reducing the risk for obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Epidemiological studies have indicated that maintaining a consistent long overnight fast, which is similar to TRE, can significantly reduce risks for chronic diseases. Despite these early successes, more clinical and mechanistic studies are needed to implement TRE alone or as adjuvant lifestyle intervention for the prevention and management of chronic metabolic diseases.",

In this study we assessed whether nonpromoter CDKN2A methylation in laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas (LXSCC) conferred a similar association with transcription that predicted patient outcome. We compared DNA methylation and ARF/INK4a RNA expression levels for the CDKN2A locus using the Illumina HumanMethylation27 beadchip and RT-PCR in 43 LXSCC tumor samples collected from a prospective study of head and neck cancer patients treated at Montefiore Medical Center (MMC). Validation was performed using RNAseq data on 111 LXSCC tumor samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The clinical relevance of combined nonpromoter CDKN2A methylation and transcription was assessed by multivariate Cox regression for locoregional recurrence on a subset of 69 LXSCC patients with complete clinicopathologic data from the MMC and TCGA cohorts. We found evidence of CDKN2A nonpromoter hypermethylation in a third of LXSCC from our MMC cohort, which was significantly associated with increased ARF and INK4a RNA expression ( Wilcoxon rank-sum, P = 0.007 and 0.003, respectively). A similar association was confirmed in TCGA samples (Wilcoxon rank-sum test P &lt; 0.0001 for ARF and INK4a). Patients with CDKN2A hypermethylation or high ARF/INK4a expression were significantly less likely to develop a locoregional recurrence compared to those with neither of the features, independent of other clinicopatholgic risk factors (adjusted hazard ratio= 0.21, 95% confidence interval: 0.05-0.81). These results support the conclusion that CDKN2A nonpromoter methylation is associated with increased ARF and INK4a RNA expression, and improved locoregional control in LXSCC.",

    "abstract": "During a power system disturbance, an Energy Management System can present an overwhelming number of alarms to the power system operators within a short period of time. This leads to operator confusion and makes problem analysis difEcult. A knowledgebased alarm processing sys- tem which incorporates the expertise of experienced power system operators can use the knowledge to present meaning- ful, concise diagnostic messages to the operators. The knowledgebased system reduces the number of alarms that the operators must view and comprehend. It also diagnoses the current situation on the power system. The concise mes- sages allow the operators to quickly isolate and minimize the effects of the disturbance so that the power system may be restored as rapidly as possible. This paper presents a novel station oriented knowledgebased alarm processor prototype that has been developed for the Wisconsin Electric Power Company SCADA system. The knowledgebased system accesses a configuration database that contains information on both the topology of the power sys- tem as well as symbolic data values. Forward chaining rules are used to form hypotheses when state changes OCCUT on the power system. Backward chaining rules then attempt to prove each hypothesis using the current facts and the configuration database. Metalevel control rules improve sys- tem performance by selecting goals and doing context switch- ing during the inference process. A rulebased management system is also introduced. The knowledgebased system con- tinuously analyzes and procgses SCADA alarms in real-time, presenting diagnostic messages to the power system operators without requiring any information from the operators.

Applications of ecological theory had generated debate about reserve design in the 1970s and 1980s, when problems of reserve design were reformulated to draw on the methods of operations research and decision science. Advances in simulation modeling, especially models of forest growth, provided new tools for understanding ecological dynamics.

These are the first dating data for Mesozoic intermediate-acid intrusive rocks in Bogurda region. These data confirmed that the eastern part of Tianshan experienced magmatic activity in Late Jurassic.

To this objective, a dynamically reconfigurable multi-microprocessor architecture is proposed, realizing concurrently the regular decomposition and the W-H transformation of digital images and the resulting image subquadrants. The C-MOVE architecture is used for the implementation of the transformation, because the numerical simplicity of the W-H transform operations can be efficiently implemented by a small set of microprocessor instructions, something inherent in the C-MOVE architecture. The pipelined architecture of the proposed design is very efficiently to the simultaneous implementation of the regular decomposition and the orthogonal transformation of the resulting subquadrants of the pictures. This task is performed by dynamically adjusting to the subquadrants dimensionality, as the processing progresses through the various hierarchies of nodes of the quadtree which is associated with the processed picture, according to the regular decomposition procedure.",

    "abstract": "Fractional-order chaos has complex dynamic behavior characteristics, so its application in secure communication has attracted much attention. Compared with the design of fractional-order chaos-based cipher, there are fewer researches on security analysis. This paper conducts a comprehensive security analysis of a color image encryption algorithm using a fractional-order hyperchaotic system (CIEA-FOHS). Experimental simulation based on excellent numerical statistical results supported that CIEA-FOHS is cryptographically secure. Yet, from the perspective of cryptanalysis, this paper found that CIEA-FOHS can be broken by a chosen-plaintext attack method owing to its some inherent security defects. Firstly, the diffusion part can be eliminated by choosing some special images with all the same pixel values. Secondly, the permutation-only part can be deciphered by some chosen plain images and the corresponding cipher images. Finally, using the equivalent diffusion and permutation keys obtained in the previous two steps, the original plain image can be recovered from a target cipher image. Theoretical analysis and experimental simulations show that the attack method is both effective and efficient. To enhance the security, some suggestions for improvement are given. The reported results would help the designers of chaotic cryptography pay more attention to the gap of complex chaotic system and secure cryptosystem.",

The other factor is that the majority of learners studying through the medium of English are usually second or third language speakers. It has been noticeable that the education crisis has continued in post-apartheid South Africa. This study investigates the role of data handling in teaching and learning of mathematics among grade 7 students. A qualitative research approach was adopted with semi structure interview as the major instrument to elicit information from the respondents. In addition, document analysis was also used get information concerning the teacher and learners\u2019 performance. One hundred and twenty-five participants (125) were chosen using simple random sampling techniques. The information gathered were coded, transcribed, and categorised according to the different themes. The findings revealed among others that, only 11% of the respondents specialised in mathematics; 78% said that their schools did not have enough teachers and learners support materials. Less than 60% of the respondents involved their learners during the teaching and learning and only 11% said that their students always do their homework. It was recommended among others that greater attention should be paid to the needs of larger number of students who currently learn very little useful mathematics; Major innovation is needed to develop a provision that meets the diverse needs of all our students and not just the most talented DOI: 10.5901/mjss.2014.v5n23p1151",

The combination of genetic algorithms and compliant mechanisms is an effective and interesting combination of two biologically inspired engineering design areas. This paper will describe and demonstrate the successful use of genetic programming to create a general design tool for topological synthesis of compliant mechanisms. Features that exploit the implementation of genetic algorithms to compliant mechanism design, such as multiple criteria specification, multiple-design parameter variation, and final selections from a family of solutions will be presented and discussed.

The growth characteristics and wood properties had abundant variation between different families. The variation coefficient of tree height,DBH and volume were bigger than the cellulose content,hemi-cellulose content,lignin content and wood basic density. The variation coefficient of the volume was maximum of 21. 77%. Cellulose content variation coefficient was minimum of 3. 78%. The correlation between growth characteristics and wood properties was insignificant,which can be chosen independently. The differences of tree height,DBH,volume and cellulose content were significant between the families,and the difference of wood basic density,hemi-cellulose content and lignin content was insignificant between the families. The heritability of tree volume and cellulose content were 68. 4% and 49. 1%,respectively,under above middle-heritability control. Based on growth and wood traits,three families were selected for pulpwood production: J3 \u00d7 X8( L. kaempferi 3 \u00d7 L. gmelinii8),J5 \u00d7 X8(L. kaempferi 5 \u00d7 L. gmelinii 8) and J11 \u00d7 S51(L. kaempferi 11 \u00d7 L. olgensis 51).

To pursue an aggressive R and D program at a reasonable cost, it was decided to conduct extensive large scale testing in wind tunnel and flight simulation facilities, to develop low cost research aircraft using modified airframes or engines, and to involve other agencies and industry contractors in joint technical and funding arrangements. The STOL investigations include exploring STOL performance using the rotating cylinder flap concept, the augmentor wing, upon initiation of the Quiet Short Haul Research Aircraft program, the upper surface blown flap concept.

    "abstract": "Today terrorists usually work in network forms to conduct attacks. Terrorist networks remain active and can still function even after being severely damaged by authorities. Analyzing terrorist networks from a dynamic point of view can provide insights about the mechanisms responsible for the survival of terrorist organizations. This paper studies the dynamics of a major international terrorist organization over a 14-year period - the Global Salafi Jihad (GSJ) terrorist network. We found that a scale-free topology gradually emerged as new members joined the GSJ network based on operational needs. In addition, since the network has been experiencing member losses while it grows, we also studied the robustness of the GSJ network. We used a simulation approach to examine its vulnerability to random failures, targeted attacks, and real world authorities' counterattacks. We found that authorities' counterattacks have been rather ineffective in disrupting the terrorist network.",

The first requirement before designing hardware or writing a program is to describe what an application is required to do, the specifications which defines the user's requirement. Once the specification has been written, a prototype hardware design can be attempted and a useful starting point for hardware design is a block diagram and it should represent the main parts of a system and the signal/data flow between them in a simplified form. This can later be converted to circuit diagrams and the hardware connections laid out and constructed on a printed circuit board (PCB). Software can be designed using techniques that allow the application program to be outlined, and then the details progressively filled in and flowcharts are used to help in program design. Pseudocode is another useful method for designing software and this is a program outline in text form that can be entered directly into the source code editor as a set of general statements that describe each major block, which would be defined as functions and procedures in a high-level language and subroutines and macros in a low-level language.",

    "abstract": "Zero-knowledge proofs allow a prover to convince a verifier of the veracity of a statement without revealing any other information. An interesting class of zero-knowledge protocols are those following the MPC-in-the-head paradigm (Ishai et al., STOC \u201907) which use secure multiparty computation (MPC) protocols as the basis. Efficient instances of this paradigm have emerged as an active research topic in the last years, starting with ZKBoo (Giacomelli et al., USENIX \u201916). Zero-knowledge protocols are a vital building block in the design of privacy-preserving technologies as well as cryptographic primitives like digital signature schemes that provide post-quantum security. This work investigates the security of zero-knowledge protocols following the MPC-in-the-head paradigm. We provide the first machine-checked security proof of such a protocol on the example of ZKBoo. Our proofs are checked in the EasyCrypt proof assistant. To enable a modular security proof, we develop a new security notion for the MPC protocols used in MPC-in-the-head zero-knowledge protocols. This allows us to recast existing security proofs in a black-box fashion which we believe to be of independent interest.",

He [9] proposed a single image visibility restoration method using dark channel prior (DCP). Among many algorithms, this DCP algorithm is known to have good performance in various fog images. However, this method requires matting processing, which requires a large amount of computation to refine the block type of the transmission amount. In this paper, we propose an improved image visibility restoration algorithm that estimates the transmission amount using a hybrid-type multi-filter based on edge intensity information to more accurately remove haze at the boundary. Through the experiment of a proposed algorithm, we show that haze is effectively eliminated without using matting processing. In particular, the algorithm is more effective at the boundary region.",

Gas chromatograph-mass spectroscopic analysis of the fatty acid methyl esters indicated that the deuterated fatty acid was incorporated into the cholesterol esters of these tissues. The proportion of the labeled 26:0 to nonlabeled 26:0 was highest in the area of mild involvement.

In addition, the inference result, which is typically an abstract, numerical trustworthiness score, might be difficult for the end-user to interpret. In this paper, we propose sub graph extraction to address these challenges. The core of the proposed method consists of two stages: path selection and component induction. The outputs of both stages can be used as an intermediate step to speed up a variety of existing trust inference algorithms. Our experimental evaluations on real graphs show that the proposed method can accelerate existing trust inference algorithms, while maintaining high accuracy.

    "title": "Evaluation of Two ANN Approaches for the Wind Power Forecast in a Mountainous Site",
    "abstract": "Accurate wind power forecast is very important in order to construct smart electric grids. Nevertheless, this task still constitutes a challenge because wind is a very variable and local phenomenon. It is difficult to downscale information coming from Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models down to wind farm level and this is especially true onshore, in complex terrain conditions. Artificial Intelligence often comes at hand, for its power in learning what is hidden inside data: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are therefore commonly employed for wind power forecast. In this work, a pure ANN method is compared against a hybrid method, based on the combination of ANN and a numerical method based on physically-consistent assumptions (Computational Fluid Dynamics). Both approaches are validated against the SCADA data of a wind farm sited in Italy in a very complex terrain. It arises that the two methods have overall similar performances on average. However, pure ANN turns out to forecast better at mid-energy levels and during cut-off events at the highest wind speed, whereas the hybrid method forecasts better during low and high wind speed ranges. This makes the two approaches complementary and promising for future applications through an ensemble strategy.",

It is an event-based simulation of all known individual debris-generating events since 1957, including breakups, solid rocket motor firings and nuclear reactor core ejections. In 2014, the upgraded version of the Debris Risk Assessment and Mitigation Analysis (DRAMA) tool suite was released. In the same year an ESA instruction made the standard ISO 24113:2011 on space debris mitigation requirements, adopted via the European Cooperation for Space Standardization (ECSS), applicable to all ESA missions. In order to verify the compliance of a space mission with those requirements, the DRAMA software is used to assess collision avoidance statistics, estimate the remaining orbital lifetime and evaluate the on-ground risk for controlled and uncontrolled re-entries. In this paper, the approach to validate the MASTER and DRAMA tools is outlined. For MASTER, recent observation campaign results shall be discussed. In DRAMA, the assessment of collision avoidance statistics is based on orbit uncertainty information derived from Conjunction Data Messages (CDM) provided by the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC).

    "abstract": "At present, social network sites (SNSs) have become the major channels by which disinformation is released and disseminated. Without the effective control of disinformation on social media, a serious threat to social stability may occur. Different from traditional media, forwarding has become the key approach to propagating information on social media. Therefore, if the users who will forward the disinformation are identified in advance, they can be prevented from forwarding the disinformation and the harmful effects of disinformation will be minimized. To identify the users who will forward the disinformation, we should predict the probability of an individual forwarding disinformation. We propose a novel method to predict the disinformation forwarding probability of individuals on a social network. The proposed method extracts the features that affect individual disinformation forwarding, especially extracting features related to the susceptibility of users to disinformation. With combining bootstrap sampling and expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to learn unobserved features, the proposed method utilizes both observed and unobserved features to predict the disinformation forwarding probability of individuals. Using data from \u201cWeibo,\u201d which is the largest social media platform in China, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "To understand security vulnerabilities of communication protocols used in power systems, a real-time framework can be developed to conduct vulnerability studies. The framework should implement protection mechanisms against vulnerabilities and study their effectiveness. In this paper, a real-time cyber-physical framework or test bed is presented. It integrates a real-time power system simulator and a communication system simulator to study the cyber and physical system vulnerabilities in smart power grids. The power system simulation is implemented using the Real-Time Digital Simulator (RTDS (R)) power grid simulator, with LabVIEW and PXI modules that simulate the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system and intelligent electronic devices (IEDs). The communication system simulation is implemented using Opnet's System-in-the-Loop (SITL) simulator and open source Linux tools and servers. Results of two cyber-attacks on the Modbus/TCP protocol are discussed and improvements to the test bed for protocol attack detection and mitigation are proposed.",

    "title": "The subfertility handbook: Assessment of the male partner",
    "abstract": "Introduction Though this chapter will deal in detail with the clinical assessment of the male partner in an infertile couple, it is necessary to emphasize (as described in Chapter 2) the importance of treating the couple rather than just the individual. There is no doubt that subfertility frequently occurs in both partners and the effects tend, on the basis of a number of studies, to be synergistic rather than additive. Therefore both partners in any couple with subfertility must be assessed fully and a strategy of investigation and management planned that takes account of them both. Thus the assessment of the male should occur in parallel with the assessment outlined in Chapter 3 for the female partner. With the recent exciting developments in assisted reproductive technologies, particularly as applied to male subfertility (as outlined in Chapter 10), there is a temptation to take a minimalistic approach to the assessment of the male partner and to rely simply on the semen analysis followed by a decision as to whether to proceed to in-vitro fertilization, perhaps with sperm microinjection. It is important to recognize that there are uncommon but potentially treatable and/or preventable causes of male subfertility which should be identified before proceeding to more invasive and expensive technologies. The couple must be made fully aware of the options available to them, including the likely success rates, complications and expenses involved.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces the idea of using mechanical steering compensators to improve the dynamic behavior of high-performance motorcycles. These compensators are seen as possible replacements for a conventional steering damper and comprise networks of springs, dampers, and a less familiar component called the inerter. The inerter was recently introduced to allow the synthesis of arbitrary passive mechanical impedances, and finds a potential application in the present work. The design and synthesis of these compensation systems make use of the analogy between passive electrical and mechanical networks. This analogy is reviewed alongside the links between passivity, positive reality, and network synthesis. Compensator design methods that are based on classical Bode-Nyquist frequency-response ideas are presented. Initial designs are subsequently optimized using a sequential quadratic programing algorithm. This optimization process ensures improved performance over the machine\u2019s entire operating regime. The investigation is developed from an analysis of specific mechanical networks to the class of all biquadratic positive real functions. This aspect of the research is directed to answering the question: \u201cWhat is the best possible system performance achievable using any simple passive mechanical network compensator?\u201d The study makes use of computer simulations, which exploit a state-of-the-art motorcycle model whose parameter set is based on a Suzuki GSX-R1000 sports machine. The results show that, compared to a conventional steering damper, it is possible to obtain significant improvements in the dynamic properties of the primary oscillatory modes, known as \u201cwobble\u201d and \u201cweave.\u201d DOI: 10.1115/1.2198547",

    "abstract": "The development of satellite communication technology is easy to identify the vehicle locations. Vehicle tracking systems have brought this technology to the day-to-day life of the common person. Today GPS used in cars ambulances; fleets and police vehicles are common sights on the roads of developed countries. All the existing technology supports in tracking the vehicle place and status. Currently, majority of people owns a vehicle. Theft cases however kept happening in parking area and also in some other insecurity places. The safety of the vehicle in public areas is the main concern to the car owner. So an advanced system that makes use of an embedded system based on GSM technology is suggested to overcome the problem. This system is installed in the vehicle.\r\nThe GPS/GSM based system is one of the most important systems, which integrate both GSM and GPS technologies. It is necessary due to the many of applications of both GSM and GPS systems and the wide usage of them by millions of people throughout the world. This system designed for users in land construction and transport business, to provide real-time information such as location, speed and expected arrival time of a moving vehicle in a concise and easy-to-read format.\r\nThis project deals with an SMS (Short Message Service) enabled vehicle tracking system. The heart of this project lies with the use of a GPS + GSM modem which is installed in the vehicle and is in charge of tracking the vehicle and sending the coordinates to the GSM (Global System for Mobile communication) modem. The GSM modem in the control center receives the coordinates via SMS and updates the main database which contains all the whereabouts of all the vehicles at specified times. This thesis explores the foundation of GPS, GSM, and all the software related in the project; and the use of their concepts to produce a vehicle tracking and locking system which is cheaper and more effective than most commercial car tracking features in the market today.",

    "abstract": "It is important to select representative patterns for successful classification of remotely sensing images. In the paper, a superpixel-based active learning (shorted as SPAL) algorithm is proposed to iteratively select informative unlabeled samples for labeling by experts. In particular, new representation of a remote sensing image is generated by grouping the data into perceptually meaningful atomic regions, i.e., super-pixels which have both spectral similarity and spatial adjacency. Then, active learning is iteratively exploited to select informative samples to enlarge the training dataset. At each iteration, the unlabeled samples are firstly sorted according to a prefixed uncertain strategy. Then, the few highest uncertain samples are selected on the assumption that all the samples selected at each iteration are from different superpixels in order to guarantee the diversity. The proposed SPAL algorithm is validated by real hyperspectral images. Experimental results show that the SPAL can improve the classification accuracies as well as significant enhancement of computational efficiency.",

    "abstract": "With quality of experience (QoE) taking a center stage in the evaluation of wireless telecommunication system, optimizing the performance of heterogeneous wireless networks (HWNs) is in need of taking service QoE into consideration. End to end QoE of video services in HWN is determined by not only the network but also the video characteristics. In this paper, a metric termed as QoE coverage is proposed to evaluate the coverage performance of HWNs for video services. First, subjective quality test is performed to improve the existing video quality prediction model, and the expression of QoE coverage is derived by combining video and network parameters. Second, two QoE provisioning schemes, i.e., homogeneous and heterogeneous quality thresholds of HWN are analyzed to show the mathematic properties. Third, a Monte Carlo simulation is performed to show its differences to SINR coverage. Compared with state-of-the-art SINR coverage, QoE coverage takes both physical layer and application layer parameters into consideration and provides more realistic user satisfactory. Results show that QoE coverage can be well maintained by adjusting target QoE thresholds, modulation and coding schemes with different videos.",

    "abstract": "Background\r\n\r\nVascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a pro-inflammatory mediator as well as a vascular permeability factor in bronchial asthma. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I is also involved in the inflammatory process associated with bronchial asthma and stimulates VEGF expression. The IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs), especially IGFBP-3, display distinctive properties and can interfere with various biological processes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods\r\n\r\nIn this study, an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced murine model of allergic airway disease was used to investigate which mechanism is implicated in the preventive and therapeutic actions of IGFBP-3 administered exogenously on allergen-induced bronchial inflammation and airway hyper-responsiveness, in particular focusing on the regulation of VEGF expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults\r\n\r\nAdministration of recombinant human IGFBP-3 to OVA-inhaled mice substantially attenuated the increases in hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-\u03b1 activity, IGF-I production, and VEGF protein levels in the lung. In addition, the blockade of IGF-I action decreased the OVA-induced VEGF expression, airway inflammation, and bronchial hyper-responsiveness. The administration of recombinant human IGFBP-3 or CBO-P11 also reduced significantly increases in inflammatory cells, airway hyper-responsiveness, levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and vascular permeability in the lung of OVA-inhaled mice. Moreover, when recombinant human IGFBP-3 was administered after the completion of OVA inhalation, these therapeutic effects of IGFBP-3 were also observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\n\r\nThese results indicate that IGFBP-3 administered exogenously may attenuate antigen-induced airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness through the modulation of vascular leakage and VEGF expression mediated by HIF-1\u03b1/HIF-2\u03b1 signaling as well as IGF-I action in allergic airway disease of mice.",

There were other reasons too: the concern of emperors to hinder potential rivals; the sheer difficulty of advancing to the Elbe; and the increasing concern of the emperor and his advisers for the fiscal effects of this and other potential conquests.

    "abstract": "Objective: To determine whether a neuromuscular rehabilitation program can improve postural stability and ankle-evertor strength and to examine the temporal changes and persistence of the rehabilitation effects in athletes with chronic ankle instability (CM). Design: A total of 21 national women field hockey players participated in this study (CAI, n = 12; control, n = 9). Main Outcome Measures: Isokinetic ankle-evertor strength (peak torque [PT], total work [TW]) at 30 degrees/s, 60 degrees/s, 90 degrees/s, and 120 degrees/s, mediolateral stability index (MSI), and dynamic stability test (TCT). Data were recorded at baseline, 6 wk, and 24 wk. Results: At baseline, isokinetic evertor strength was comparable between groups. At 6 wk, the CAI group demonstrated significantly increased eccentric PT and TW at 30 degrees/s and 60 degrees/s and increased concentric/eccentric TW at 90 degrees/s. The control group showed significantly increased concentric TW at 30 degrees/s and increased concentric PT and TW at 90 degrees/s. At 24 wk, except for eccentric PT at 60 degrees/s and 120 degrees/s, concentric/eccentric PT and TW were significantly increased in the CAI group. The control group showed significantly increased TW at all angular velocities regardless of contraction mode. The CM group exhibited significant increases in concentric/eccentric evertor PT and TW at 120 degrees/s in comparison with the control group. MSI and TCT decreased in both groups at 6 wk; however, the CAI group demonstrated significant increases in both measures at 24 wk, whereas the control group showed no significant change. Conclusions: The results suggest that the neuromuscular rehabilitation program had an immediate effect on gaining eccentric evertor strength and improving postural control and appeared to contribute to enhancing the evertor strength of unstable ankles in the longer term. On the other hand, improved postural stability did not seem to persist.",

The paper (1) establishes the importance of rhythmic artflow for deep trans- formation by reviewing analogous ancient uses of visual and musical rhythm; (2) examines expressive arts therapy as a contemporary vehicle in this regard, suggesting that the expressive therapist is a modern-day shaman in facilitating transformation via imagery; (3) describes shamanism involving visionary emer- gent worlds; (4) unifies these views by drawing explicit comparisons of therapist and shaman; (5) suggests need of a conceptual model of emergent worlds; (6) for this, tentatively combines two complementary philosophies--exis- tential phenomenology derivative from Heideg- ger, and the East Indian matrika shakti system; and (7) focuses on phenomenology and its associated psychotherapies.

They have recently attract attention as a good model for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlay networks. Existing work gives results on networks with constraints of node upload capacities. In this paper, we consider networks with constraints on both node upload and node download capacity. For such networks, we investigate the rate optimality of routing versus network coding. In general, network coding achieves a larger rate region than routing. However, for some important communication scenarios, routing achieves the same rate region as network coding.",

    "abstract": "High-speed, digital, internally-programmed, automatic checkout equipment is a powerful test tool whose impact has not yet been felt in testing large complex systems. It has, in certain ways, much higher test capabilities than either a sequentially programmed machine or a human operator. For these capabilities to be harnessed, new test techniques are required to ensure that failures or weaknesses are detected and separated from normal drifts. These techniques involve the design-of-the-prime system to secure through instrumentation, wiring, test points, and other built-in provisions, precisely the kind and quantity of test data needed. The test techniques involve improvement of several present-day test practices. The selection of test points, for example, is based upon both broad and detailed quantitative factors related to probability-of-mission-success, and reliability, rather than upon intuition, but with ample opportunity for the exercise of the designer's judgment. In general, more data are required, but the pay-off is in greatly increased reliability and availability, together with lower net costs. The immediate objectives of failure detection, prediction, prevention, and isolation are defined and a test program is described whose purpose is to maximize the failure information content of the test data rather than to reconfirm abstract design parameters. One technique described is called ``inferential testing'' or ``introspective testing'' which, complemented by end-to-end testing, is especially powerful in testing closed-loop systems. Another approach and technique described is that of wringing all possible test data from a fixed set of test points by ``network testing.",

We determine analytically the effect of the artificial gauge field on the density-wave--supersolid (DW-SS) and the Mott-insulator--superfluid (MI-SF) transition boundary. The momentum distribution at these two transition boundaries is also calculated in this approach. It is shown that such a momentum distribution, which can be observed in time-of-flight measurements, reveals the symmetry of the gauge potential through the formation of a magnetic Brillouin zone and clearly distinguishes between the DW-SS and MI-SF boundary.

The features and applicationsof acousto-optic devices and encountered problems are discussed. The sound fielddistribution can influence the diffraction efficiency of the acousto-optic modulator andthe beam quality of the diffracted beam. In this research, the ultrasonic sound fielddistribution model generated from ultrasonic transducer is investigated, the factors ofnon-uniform sound field that affect the diffraction efficiency are analyzed, thenon-reciprocal effects of acousto-optic devices and its influence on the laser heterodyneinterference effects are also discussed. A summary of the development and applicationof acousto-optic devices and its operating characteristics is given.\nThe first part of the paper, the general form of the sound and light coupled waveequations are derived from the parametric interactive point of view, and the interactionof the sound and light is analyzed by using the momentum matching and momentummismatch. The properties of the tellurium oxide acousto-optic devices are studiedthrough simulation and experiment, and then the acousto-optic diffraction efficiencycurves are obtained, the experimental results agree well with the theory. Based on thekind of non-uniform sound field theoretical analysis is made, and the result that thedecline in beam quality of the diffraction beam caused by the uneven sound field isexamined. The main reasons of the decline of diffraction beam quality led byacousto-optic crystal are studied. The experimental test measurement of theacousto-optic diffraction efficiency is made, and the measured data are processed andanalyzed. Through the comparison with the theoretical analysis, we can see that thediffraction beam quality deterioration and reduced efficiency was caused by the unevendistribution of spatial sound field.\nThe second part of the paper, because of the fact that sound reflection leads touneven distribution of sound field in the crystal, a light beam diaphragm method isproposed. First of all, the non-uniform grating contrast model is proposed from theinfluence on volume grating contrast and diffraction efficiency. By use of the theoreticalsimulation and experimental measurements, proof of the transmission performance ofthe aperture method is examined. In addition, through the beam diaphragm method thecenter dark lines in spot of the diffracted beam is eliminated in the heterodyneinterferometer experiments, and the beam spot shows much more uniform. This methodcan improve the diffraction beam quality and improve heterodyne interferometer performance.\nThe third part of the paper, based on the Rayleigh integral, the axisymmetricultrasonic transducer of sound field distribution characteristics is analysed. By use of anelliptical Gaussian modeling the piezoelectric transducer sound field distribution isdescribed, the radiation distribution for spatial sound field is analyzed, and numericalcomputation is also made. Through analysis and simulation modeling, the sound fielddistributions are discussed for different crystal location and attenuation. Then therelationship between the sound field distribution and the diffraction efficiencydistribution is derived, and the optical field distributions are computed for severaldiffraction conditions. At the end of this part, the condition under which the sound fieldin the crystal is uniform, and the diffraction efficiency on the acoustic axis are given.\nThe fourth part of the paper, according to the beam forward and back transmissionin the acousto-optic devices, there exist different diffraction efficiency. From this kindof non-reciprocal phenomenon in the acousto-optic device, the consideration of thefactors to influence the diffraction efficiency and the laser heterodyne interferometerefficiency owing to the diffracted light attenuation are discussed. By use of thenon-reciprocal theory the acousto-optic device operating characteristics which havedriven by100MHz are analysed. The frequency shift resulted from non-reciprocal effectcan be determined by help of comparison of the transmission bandwidth of theacousto-optic device. Experimental results indicate that in tellurium oxide acoustic-opticdevices there exist non-reciprocal effect, it is shown that the direction of acoustic wavepropagation effects not only the light diffraction\u2019s direction also the change oftransmission bandwidth. In tellurium oxide crystal such change can be as high as50~60%of the total bandwidth.\nIn the research of laser heterodyne interferometer for coherent detection technology,the non-reciprocal effect in acousto-optic device can be used to determine the impactson heterodyne IF signal. And by use of the non-reciprocal effect the gain of laserheterodyne IF signal could be improved. The experiment shows: when the radiofrequency is tuned to a working range from100to105MHz for the acoustic opticmodulator (AOM), the diffraction efficiency reaches the maximum value of98%. Byuse of the non-reciprocal effect, a7.7dB voltage gain of diffraction efficiency can beobtained and heterodyne signal power increases by+13dBm to+21dBm.  ",

This paper explores the current cutting edge applications of CNN on single and multimodality (combination of two or more modalities) neuroimaging data for the classification of AD. An exhaustive systematic search is conducted on four notable databases: Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and PubMed in June 2021. The objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness of classification approaches on AD to analyze different kinds of datasets, neuroimaging modalities, preprocessing techniques, and data handling methods.

One of the main challenges in simulation is the complex socket/contact geometry convoluted with its massive number of degrees of freedom. This paper proposes a technique, Contact Isolation Method (CIM), to simplify the geometry so that it can be modeled with highly reduced degrees of freedom (DOFs) while still maintaining 90% of the in-plane and out-of-plane stiffness compared with the original structure. The Pin Grid Array 700 socket (PGA700) and Pin Grid Array 604 socket (PGA604) were used as case studies to demonstrate this methodology. A system model was completed for the PGA604 socket with a focus on its capability to assess SJR. A reasonable correlation between the modeling and experiment on the dynamic board strain demonstrates that this technique is viable. In addition, this paper verifies that the board strain is a proper metric for the risk assessment in SJR, and defines the optimal strain gauge location.

After mean statistics of these records, we think that the characteristics of near-fault ground motion are notable when the distance to fault is less than 25 km. Using these 440 records ( fault distance not larger than 25 km) from 22 earthquakes, near-fault attenuation characteristics of horizontal and vertical peak ground acceleration are studied. Horizontal data are grouped into stiff soil and soft soil site and vertical data are only regarded to soil site. The parameters are calculated by least square method. For a magnitude, PGA attenuation curve surface is drawn in 3d coordinate axis. Near-fault peak horizontal and vertical ground accelerations and V/H attenuation relationship are studied.",

Central questions when defining this origin is what constitutes the base of professional knowledge and whether such a base is specific to each profession. However, what such knowledge may be has proven hard to agree on, since such knowledge is what research in professions and professional work strive to produce. The paper instead proposes a different way to describe and categorize research in professions, which does not presume any one definition of neither profession nor knowledge.

    "abstract": "Alopecia areata (AA) has been considered to be supported by an aberrant expression of IFN-gamma as a result of antigen dependent immune response. On the other hand, AA sometimes concurs with atopic diseases, although the mechanism of the concurrence is not clear. This study was designed to elucidate the immune status of AA and the similarity between AA and atopic dermatitis (AD) by analysis of in vivo levels of mRNA of Th1, Th2, and suppressive cytokines of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Using semiquantitative RT-PCR, the levels of cytokine mRNA were measured in freshly isolated PBMC of 47 patients with AA, 15 patients with AD, and 12 healthy controls (HC). The levels of IL-4, IFN-gamma, and TGF-beta 1 mRNA were lower in patients with AA than those in HC. The levels of IL-10 mRNA in AA were comparable with those in HC. Decreased levels of IFN-gamma and TGF-beta 1 were also shown in patients with AD. These results indicated a similarity (decreased levels of IFN-gamma and TGF-beta 1) between AD and AA based on the cytokine profile. In addition, decreased levels of IL-4 mRNA in AA might also explain the experience that the severity of atopic disease coincident with AA is mild in the most of cases. Next, we compared the levels of these cytokine mRNA among the three subgroups of AA that were categorized based on the severity of the symptoms: mild, severe and totalis. Although there was no significant difference between any combinations of the subgroups, there was a tendency to increase the levels of IFN-gamma mRNA and to decrease the levels of IL-4 mRNA according to the severity of alopecia. However, the levels of IFN-gamma mRNA in any subgroups were less than those of HC. These results suggest that IFN-gamma is therefore involved in the pathogenesis of AA, although the information from PBMC is limited. In conclusion, AA might be induced by an aberrant expression of IFN-gamma in individuals whose PBMC produce low amounts of IFN-gamma and TGF-beta 1. Further analysis is therefore required to investigate the phenotypes of the population in PBMC with or without reference to regulatory T cells.",

    "abstract": "Description of a record of Macroclemys temmincki in the Cottonwood River at Emporia, Kansas, is given, with comments on the occurrence of the turtle in the state. There are only two records, with accompanying preserved remains, of the occurrence of the alligator snapping turtle, Macroclemys temmincki, in Kansas, according to Collins (1974); one from the Arkansas River in Cowley County and the other from the Neosho River drainage in Lyon County. The Lyon County record has never been described; this note gives details on the specimen. On February 21, 1967, two young men, Rick Christie and J. M. McDaniel, found a large alligator snapping turtle in the Cottonwood River at Emporia. It was at the shore, just below Soden's Dam at the south end of Commercial Street. The turtle was dead and beginning to decompose. The skull and shell were salvaged and placed in the vertebrate museum at Emporia State University, cataloged as H2237. The specimen, a male, weighed 54 pounds, has a carapace length of 55.8 cm, carapace width of 44.1 cm, and plastron length of 36.0 cm. Conversations with local fishermen over the years reveal that they can distinguish between two kinds of snapping turtles they catch in the Cottonwood River. One, to which they apply the appellation \"mossy back,\" is described as a large snapping turtle with a pronounced beak and prominent carapace ridges, as distinct from other large, rather smooth-shelled snappers. Thus, the alligator snapping turtle, although not often in collections, apparently does turn up occasionally on fishing lines. Its predilection for bottoms of large, deeper water courses keeps it from discovery through conventional collecting techniques. Hall and Smith (1947) reported seven separate collections of the alligator snapping turtle from the Neosho River in Cherokee County and one from Neosho County. One specimen was taken from the Cottonwood River in",

    "abstract": "The main disadvantage of vision-based control systems is the inherent time delay due to the processing of the image information, which leads to significant performance losses of the control system. We present a cascaded Kalman Filter structure to compensate for the time delay introduced by the 6d pose estimation in vision based control systems. In addition to delay compensation the structure allows all sensor data to be used asynchronously for state correction. The first Kalman Filter runs in the past and compensates for the time delay of the pose estimation. The second Kalman Filter is used exclusively for sensor data fusion. A special structure within the filter allows all sensor data to be used for state correction regardless of their sampling rate. The sampling rate, at which the second Kalman filter provides the state vector for a controller, can be set independently of all other variables. The entire structure has been tested by simulation and in experiments on a three degree of freedom robot. By applying the cascaded Kalman Filter structure, the position as well as angular errors in orientation can be reduced by more than 50%.",

    "abstract": "Many western North American forest types have experienced considerable changes in ecosystem structure, composition, and function as a result of both fire exclusion and timber harvesting. These two influences co-occurred over a large portion of dry forests, making it difficult to know the strength of either one on its own or the potential for an interaction between the two. In this study, we used contemporary remeasurements of a systematic historical forest inventory to investigate forest change in the Sierra Nevada. The historical data opportunistically spanned a significant land management agency boundary, which protected part of the inventory area from timber harvesting. This allowed for a robust comparison of forest change between logged and unlogged areas. In addition, we assessed the effects of recent management activities aimed at forest restoration relative to the same areas historically, and to other areas without recent management. Based on analyses of 22,007 trees (historical, 9,573; contemporary, 12,434), live basal area and tree density significantly increased from 1911 to the early 2000s in both logged and unlogged areas. Both shrub cover and the proportion of live basal area occupied by pine species declined from 1911 to the early 2000s in both areas, but statistical significance was inconsistent. The most notable difference between logged and unlogged areas was in the density of large trees, which declined significantly in logged areas, but was unchanged in unlogged areas. Recent management activities had a varied impact on the forest structure and composition variables analyzed. In general, areas with no recent management activities experienced the greatest change from 1911 to the early 2000s. If approximating historical forest conditions is a land management goal the documented changes in forest structure and composition from 1911 to the early 2000s indicate that active restoration, including fire use and mechanical thinning, is needed in many areas.",

However, the intricate cellular events related to RASSF1A and SHOX2 in lung cancer are still a mystery. For researchers and clinicians aiming to more profoundly understand the diagnostic value of methylated RASSF1A and SHOX2 in lung cancer, this review will provide deeper insights into the molecular events of RASSF1A and SHOX2 in lung cancer. Methodology We searched for relevant publications in the PubMed and Google Scholar databases using the keywords \"RASSF1A\", \"SHOX2\" and \"lung cancer\" etc. First, we reviewed the RASSF1A and SHOX2 genes, from their family structures to the functions of their basic structural domains. Then we mainly focused on the roles of RASSF1A and SHOX2 in lung cancer, especially on their molecular events in recent decades. Finally, we compared the value of measuring RASSF1A and SHOX2 gene methylation with that of the common methods for the diagnosis of lung cancer patients. Results The RASSF1A and SHOX2 genes were confirmed to be regulators or effectors of multiple cancer signaling pathways, driving tumorigenesis and lung cancer progression. The detection of RASSF1A and SHOX2 gene methylation has higher sensitivity and specificity than other commonly used methods for diagnosing lung cancer, especially in the early stage. Conclusions The RASSF1A and SHOX2 genes are critical for the processes of tumorigenesis, development, metastasis, drug resistance, and recurrence in lung cancer. The combined detection of RASSF1A and SHOX2 gene methylation was identified as an excellent method for the screening and surveillance of lung cancer that exhibits high sensitivity and specificity.",

    "abstract": "Performance of parallel scientific applications on many-core processor architectures is a challenge that increases every day, especially when energy efficiency is concerned. To achieve this, it is necessary to explore architectures with high processing power composed by a network-on-chip to integrate many processing cores and other components. In this context, this paper presents a design space exploration over NoC-based many-core processor architectures with distributed and shared caches, using full-system simulations. We evaluate bottlenecks in such architectures with regard to energy efficiency, using different parallel scientific applications and considering aspects from caches and NoCs jointly. Five applications from NAS Parallel Benchmarks were executed over the proposed architectures, which vary in number of cores; in L2 cache size; and in 12 types of NoC topologies. A clustered topology was set up, in which we obtain performance gains up to 30.56% and reduction in energy consumption up to 38.53%, when compared to a traditional one.",

    "abstract": "Western Chats lies to the cast of two prominent basins of western offshore viz. (1) Mumbai offshore basin, (2) Konkan-Kerala offshore basin. These basins have evolved in a divergent continental margin setting as a consequence of break LIP of Madagascar in Mid Cretaceous and Seychelles in Late Cretaceous from India. The basic framework of the Western Continental Margin of India was established by the end of Cretaceous.\nThe Surat depression in the north and the Vengurla Arch in the south define Mumbai offshore basin. Shelf margin basin marks its western limit. The width of the shelf is similar to 230 km. The entire shelf from the coast towards the shelf margin zone is segmented by basement controlled NW-SE to N-S faults giving rise to many horst-graben features. The Konkan-Kerala basin located south of the Vengurla Arch has an average width of similar to 75 kin. Eastern fringe of the basin extends to the land along the Kerala coast where outcrops of Miocene are preserved. In the west, a number of NNW-SSE trending Laxmi-Laccadive and Kori-Comorin ridges separated by depressions are identified. The basin is more differentiated in Eocene / Oligocene section with N-S trending horsts and grabens.\nThe seismic data in the basins show prominent N-S fault trends. The data further indicate the presence of strike-slip movement and associated flower structures. Therefore, the geophysical and drilling data in the western offshore support a plate tectonic model for structural styles as a result of fragmentation initiated by transform faulting. The basins came into existence in late Cretaceous and evolved through Tertiiiry, Extensive lava flows at 65 Ma are attributed as a fiSSUrc type eruption through transform faults during Deccan volcanisin. The Western Ghats may therefore, be the result of rifting and severe faulting with initial uplift and tilt to the east. The west coast of India was further elevated during the Tertiary in successive phases. The removal of vast quantities of rocks from the onshore, its deposition in the offshore basins and the associated flexural responses might have resulted in the present day Western Chats escarpment.",

    "abstract": "Qingkailing Injection (QKLI) has several pharmacological effects, such as heat-clearing, detoxifying, resolving phlegm, dredging collaterals, tranquilizing and allaying excitement, restoring consciousness and inducing resuscitation. But as its clinical applications have been broadened, the incident frequency of QKLI's adverse reaction (ADR) gradually increased. It was disclosed that that the ADRs of QKLI could occur within30min after drug treatment. The symptom can be drug fever, skin reactions, allergic shock, or ADRs associated with the blood, digestive and respiratory systems, which was recognized as acute hypersensitivity. Since the explosion of ADRs, the consequent concerns on safety caused a reduced usage of QKLI and increased questioning of its rationality, which ultimately leaded to the \"crisis of confidence\". Therefore, to find the most possible actors which cause QKLI's ADR is the fundamental solution to ensure the security of QKLI.\nCurrently, some studies have suggested that the extract liquids of honeysuckle might be the main allergen which induces pseudoallergy in QKLI. Meanwhile, the studies about IgE-mediated QKLI anaphylaxis are poor, which only established a BN rat model of acute hypersensitivity. Moreover, some studies reported that chlorogenic acid could be used as a hapten to induce immune response, while some other studies thought it could not.\nIn the present work, we established Balb/c mice model of IgE-mediated Qingkailing injection anaphylaxis, which was the first step to find the sensibilisin which caused allergic shock. Meanwhile, we also demonstrated the allergenicity of chlorogenic acid by using the methods, providing the basis for follow-up study.\nObjection\n1.

To demonstrate the allergenicity of chlorogenic acid with the method which established the Balb/c mice model of IgE-mediated Qingkailing injection anaphylaxis, providing the basis for follow-up study.\nMethods\n1Establishment of Balb/c mice model of IgE-mediated Qingkailing injection anaphylaxis\nFor the first step, we used several strategies to prepare cationic bovine serum albumin (cBSA) and QKLI-cBSA conjugate. The preparation of QKLI-cBSA was based on the Mannich reaction. Briefly,4mg of QKLI and2mg of cBSA were dissolved in physiological saline and conjugation buffer (0.1M MES pH4.8), respectively. After dropwise addition of QKL solution into the protein solution, the mixture was stirred gently, then50\u03bcl of formaldehyde were added into the mixture and immediately stirred gently for24h at37\u2103. The native bovine serum albumin (nBSA), cBSA and QKLI-cBSA conjugate were separated and purified by cationic exchange method and also identified by ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry methods.6-week-old female18BALB/c mice were randomly divided into3groups:QKLI-cBSA with alum's adjuvant group, Ovalbumin with alum's adjuvant (OVA) group and physiological saline group,6mice in each group. QKLI-cBSA conjugate were dissolved in sterilized saline and emulsified with an equal volume of Alum's adjuvant, The emulsion solutions were injected0.3mL of subcutaneously into Balb/c mice in QKLI-cBSA+Alum group; Balb/c mice of OVA group received subcutaneous injection of the same dosage respectively. Booster injections were carried out on the14th day after the primary doses. The the same quantity of immunogen emulsified with Alum's adjuvant at14days intervals. Saline group were administered the same volume of physiological saline. Mice had their blood sampling from the retro-orbital plexus just at7,14,21days after booster injections For this, after collecting, serum was allowed to repose for30min at37\u2103and thus slightly centrifuged in a bench centrifuge during10min at4\u2103and the clean material stored at-20\u2103until use. Serum was analyzed for total IgE and histamine levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), respectively.the total IgE content in mice serum. The ELISA assay was performed according to the protocol provided by the supplier, respectively. Lung reactions were evaluated by analyzing lung pathologic changes. For assessment of pathologic alterations, dissected lung tissues were washed with normal saline and then placed in10%neutral-buffered formaldehyde for1week. After fixation, lung specimens were embedded in paraffin wax, and five-micrometer sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin dye for morphology. Images of selected sections were captured at X100magnification using a zoom digital camera.\n2Investigation of allergenicity of chlorogenic acid\nFor the first step, we used several strategies to prepare cBSA and CGA-cBSA conjugate. The preparation methods of cBSA and CGA-cBSA was used as previously described. The nBSA, cBSA and CGA-cBSA conjugate were separated and purified by cationic exchange method and also identified by UV-Vis, FT-IR and MALDI-TOF-MS methods.6Balb/c mice were randomly divided into2groups: CGA-cBSA conjugate1and CGA-cBSA conjugate2; and3mice were in each group. The conjugate was dissolved in sterilized saline and emulsified with an equal volume of Alum's adjuvant, the emulsion solutions were injected0.3mL of subcutaneously into Balb/c mice in conjugate+Alum group, respectively. Booster injections were carried out at the14th day after the primary doses. The the same quantity of immunogen emulsified with Alum's adjuvant at14days intervals. Mice were bled from the retro-orbital plexus just at28days after booster injections. For this, after collecting, serum was allowed to repose for30min at37\u2103and thus slightly centrifuged in a bench centrifuge during10min at4\u2103and the supernantant was stored at-20\u2103before testing. Serum was analyzed for the titers of antibodies. Results\n1Establishment of Balb/c mice model of IgE-mediated Qingkailing injection anaphylaxis\nIn summary, the Balb/c mice model of IgE-mediated Qingkailing injection anaphylaxis was successfully established. Firstly, we separated, purificated and identified the nBSA, the cBSA and complete antigen (QKLI-cBSA). Remarkably, we separated and purified the cBSA and QKLI-cBSA conjugate by cationic ion exchange method, which was beneficial to eliminate the interference of impurities, while the previous method did not. Meanwhile, QKLI was successfully coupled with cBSA, which was identified by UV-Vis and FT-IR spectrometry methods. Secondly, Balb/c mice were then treated with subcutaneous injection of QKLI-cBSA plus alum. Thirdly, serum was analyzed for total IgE and histamine levels by ELISA, respectively. Lung reactions were evaluated by analyzing lung pathologic changes. QKLI-cBSA group mice were significantly and successfully sensitized. QKLI-cBSA conjugate significantly increased total IgE and histamine in Balb/c mice serum (P<0.05). Moreover, histological examination of QKLI-cBSA conjugate treated mice showed acute injury with pulmonary alveoli and rapture of trachea, as well as neutrophilic cell infiltration. In summary, we successfully established a murine model of IgE-mediated Qingkailing injection anaphylaxis.\n2Investigation of allergenicity of chlorogenic acid\nAllergenicity of chlorogenic acid (CGA) was further investigated. Firstly, we separated, purificated and identified the nBSA, the cBSA and complete antigen (CGA-cBSA). Remarkably, we separated and purified the cBSA and CGA-cBSA conjugate by cationic ion exchange method, which was beneficial to eliminate the interference of impurities, while the previous method did not. Meanwhile, CGA was successfully coupled with cBSA, which was identified by UV-Vis spectrometry, FT-IR spectrometry and MALDI-TOF-MS methods. Secondly, Balb/c mice were then treated with subcutaneous injection of CGA-cBSAs plus alum. After Balb/c mice were immunized with CGA-cBSAs, the similar sensitivity of antisera against CGA between the CGA-cBSA1group and CGA-BSA2group was compared. Both groups have high antibody titer, which were4000.\nConclusion:\nThe present study successfully cationized the nBSA and prepared QKLI-cBSA conjugate; and immunized the BALB/c mice with subcutaneous injection of QKLI-cBSA plus alum. After immunization, the model was verified by analyzing the total IgE and histamine levels in serum. In addition, I evaluated the lung reactions by analyzing lung pathologic changes. Finally, I successfully established a murine model of IgE-mediated Qingkailing injection anaphylaxis. The model might be enlighten allergen researchers on detecting allergens in QKLI and other Traditional Chinese Medical Injections (TCMIs). On one hand, the protocol is applicapable to validate allergenicity of CGA; on the other hand, the protocol can also be applied in establising anapylaxis animal models of other TCMIs.  ",

    "abstract": "Samsul Bahri and Masny Ernawati are Members of DPRD Kota Pekanbaru from Dapil II (Kecamatan Rumbai and Kecamatan Rumbai Pesisir), who performed the recess period in 2015. Both Members of DPRD who were elected for the 2014-2019 period were very enthusiastic to accommodate people\u201fs aspirations that were going to be recommended for policy-making process in Kota Pekanbaru especially Kecamatan Rumbai and Kecamatan Rumbai Pesisir. Because, in the context of political sociology, politics is the process of shaping and division of power in people that, among others, presents as a process of decision-making, especially those concerning development of many aspects, such as infrastructure development, and education. The aim of this research is to analyse which desired people\u201fs aspirations were realised in the recess period at Dapil II Kota Pekanbaru and to analyse the implementations of aspirations gathered in said recess period. Theories (approaches) used as the instrument of analysis in this research is the theorem of political sociology, social interactions, and leadership, while the research method used is the method of qualitative research. Research results showed that the delivered aspirations were many and varied. Samsul Bahri, there were 64 proposals delivered in the recess period of 2015, 29 (45%) of those were proposals concerning infrastructure development, while Masny Ernawati, there were 73 proposals in the recess period and 37 of them are about infrastructure development, interestingly, from Masny Ernawaty\u201fs recess period, there were many proposals in the first recess that showed up in later recess. Concerning implementations of aspirations gathered in the recess period, Samsul Bahri as a Member of DPRD Kota Pekanbaru had implemented 13 aspirations of all proposals gathered in recess period, aside of supplying studying desks for SDN 93 Pekanbaru, Samsul Bahri had gone through the development of infrastructures ranging from development of 2 MDA learning rooms, provisioning of 2 hectares marketplace, 17 nodes of street lightings, to asphalting 2 roads totalling 1.550 metres in length, including drainage and culverts. Being only one year in office, Samsul Bahri was good enough in voicing people\u201fs aspirations. Masny Ernawati as a Member of DPRD Kota Pekanbaru had performed 9 activities from interactions with people in the recess, from those 9 varied activities, Masny Ernawati had gone through the development of 1.500 metres of concrete road in Teluk Leok, development of gutters totalling 150 metres in each side of Jalan Harapan, aside of 1 drilled water well and supplying 150 pairs of studying desks and chairs for SMKN 7 Pekanbaru",

    "title": "Producing Victory: A 2007 Postscript for Implementation",
    "abstract": "This paper is a postscript to the authors 'July-August 2006 Military Review article \"Producing Victory: Rethinking Conventional Forces in COIN Operations.\" That article won the Combined Arms Center Commanding General's Special Topics Writing Competition: Countering Insurgency. \"PRODUCING VICTORY\" was an Operation Iraqi Freedom II product. We wrote the bulk of the article in mid-to-late 2005, but the essay's foundational experiences clearly ended in late 2004. We believe that we gravitated to some key principles based on those experiences--specifically, that the combined arms maneuver battalion, partnering with indigenous security forces and living among the population it secures, should be the basic tactical unit of counterinsurgency warfare. However, that does not mean that the essay could not use some updating to serve as a framework for operations in 2007. Of course, in many ways, we are manifestly unqualified to update the article. While one author keeps his hand in the intel world, he is in graduate school in Virginia; the other has served at division level since mid-2005 and makes no pretense about seeing today's Baghdad, save by air. Nevertheless, with the strategy we articulated now being made possible by the \"surge\" of Army brigades, we felt compelled to add this postscript. The tinder for ethnic and religious cruelty was always a flammable thread in the fabric of Iraq. Given the sadistic nature of the Saddam Hussein regime, the current conflagration sparked by the bombing of the Golden Dome is, in a sad way, understandable. This level of sectarian violence, new since 2004, makes the environment more complex, but it does not fundamentally change the battalion-level dynamic we prescribed. In particular, whether we portray the problem as insurgency or low-level civil war, the antidote remains much the same: a strong, representative government that has a monopoly on the use of force. The Iraqi Government needs to exert primacy over competing religious, tribal, and ethnic centers of power. It would have been preferable if this government had been built from the bottom up, drawing legitimacy from neighborhood and district advisory councils rather than from the top down, but this is now a moot point: we have to work with the government we have, not the one we wish we had. Early 2007 finds the U.S. military in Iraq responsible for two related missions: counterinsurgency in support of the Iraqi Government, and nascent peace enforcement between warring Shi'a and Sunni partisans. While analogies are slippery, our current predicament somewhat echoes pre-Dayton Bosnia. The most notable difference, of course, is that in Iraq all parties involved are also shooting at us. To be sure, this is an Iraqi problem that ultimately requires an Iraqi solution. The coalition force mission is to catalyze this process by mitigating the effects of insurgents and partisans in battalion areas of operations while assisting the Iraqi Government at all levels in developing the necessary institutions to govern. At the same time, we need to be constantly aware of actions that empower one belligerent over another, particularly within the government itself. Our mission to strengthen civil government rests on kinetic and non-kinetic foundations. As Soldiers, we are conditioned for kinetic action. While this visceral response is often the safest in the short term--and may be necessary--it often comes at the cost of local support. Four years into our experience in Iraq, it is unrealistic to expect that we would be overwhelmingly popular. But support from the population--even tacit support--is critical. Like a patient diagnosed with cancer forced to choose between chemotherapy and malignant decay, the average Iraqi can and should be expected to choose a path of distressed hope over terminal despair. But we must first demonstrate that there is such a path. Just as the 20th century required America to provide an alternative to both fascism and communism, the 21st century demands an alternative to both repressive dictatorship and Islamic extremism. \u2026",

    "abstract": "The Unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is the commonest filter for state estimation of a discrete-time nonlinear system corrupted with noise. If the process noise and measurement noise of nonlinear system are Gaussian and white, the UKF filter will be optimal. While the process or measurement noises are colored noise, the UKF filter will be instead suboptimal. In this paper, a robust UKF (R-UKF) filter is proposed in order to solve this problem. The proposed filter allows that the conventional UKF is applied for discrete-time nonlinear system corrupted with colored noise. Simulation results show that the R-UKF has better performance in estimation of the corrupted state of dynamical system by colored noise in comparison with those of using conventional UKF algorithm. \uf020",

Their success, however, depends on the design of codes that achieve these promises. It is well known that unitary matrices can be used to design differentially modulated space\u2013time codes. These codes have a particularly efficient description if they form a finite group under matrix multiplication. In this paper, we will show how to compute parameters of such groups crucial for their use as space\u2013time codes, using only the character table of the group. Since character tables for many groups are known and tabulated, this method could be used to quickly test, for a given group, which of its irreducible representations can be used to design good unitary space\u2013time codes. We demonstrate our method by computing the eigenvalues of all the irreducible representations of the special linear group ${\\rm SL}_2 (\\BBF_q)$ over a finite prime field $\\BBF_q$ of odd characteristic, and study in detail the performance of a particular eight-dimensional representation of ${\\rm SL}_2(\\BBF_{17})$.",

    "abstract": "The active appearance model (AAM), one of the most effective facial feature localization methods, is widely used in frontal facial expression recognition. However, non-frontal facial expression recognition is important in many scenarios. Thus, we propose a new method for facial expression recognition based on AAM-SIFT and adaptive regional weighting. First, multi-pose AAM templates are used for pose estimation and feature point location of the facial expression image. For effective and efficient description of these feature points, a hybrid representation, which integrates gradient direction histograms based on the descriptors of scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) and AAM, is utilized to form AAM-SIFT features. Meanwhile, according to different expression regions, AAM-SIFT features are divided into different groups and the obtained adaptive weights by means of a regional weighted method based on the fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering algorithm. Finally, the membership degree computed by FCM, which represents the possibility for each class, is regarded as the input feature vector for support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Extensive experiments on BU-3DFE database with six facial expressions and seven poses demonstrate the effectiveness of different types of weighting strategies and the influence of different features. Comparison with other state-of-art methods illustrates that the proposed method not only improves the recognition rates of the frontal face but also has better robustness for non-frontal facial expressions.

    "abstract": "Optimality Theory (OT), (Prince; Smolensky, 2004 [1993]), originated from classic generative theory, has established a consistent formal proposal for the representation of linguistic structures through the mapping of mental representations (input) and surface representations (outputs), evaluated by universal constrictions instead of rules, in a parallel way instead of a serial one, as linguistic analyses had been done so far. Regardless of its strong potential to the formalization of languages, OT is uncapable of explaining variation - an unquestionably attested characteristic of language systems -, since it does not provide the mechanisms for the generation of two or more variable outputs. OT and Harmonic Grammar (HG) derived models (Legendre; Miyata; Smolensky, 1990a, b; Smolensky; Legendre, 2006), associated to learning algorithms, arise in linguistic science in order to account for such gap left by OT. The algorithms work as computational simulators of foreign language acquisition, appearing to be efficient regarding the tasks they must perform. In this article, we present a new alternative of harmonic learning algorithm, the ORTO Ajuste Parametrico (Dornelles Filho, 2014), whose application is very similar to GLA-HG (Boersma; Hayes, 2001).

    "abstract": "We develop a generalization of existing Curry-Howard interpretations of\n(binary) session types by relying on an extension of linear logic with features\nfrom hybrid logic, in particular modal worlds that indicate domains. These\nworlds govern domain migration, subject to a parametric accessibility relation\nfamiliar from the Kripke semantics of modal logic. The result is an expressive\nnew typed process framework for domain-aware, message-passing concurrency. Its\nlogical foundations ensure that well-typed processes enjoy session fidelity,\nglobal progress, and termination. Typing also ensures that processes only\ncommunicate with accessible domains and so respect the accessibility relation.\nRemarkably, our domain-aware framework can specify scenarios in which domain\ninformation is available only at runtime; flexible accessibility relations can\nbe cleanly defined and statically enforced. As a specific application, we\nintroduce domain-aware multiparty session types, in which global protocols can\nexpress arbitrarily nested sub-protocols via domain migration. We develop a\nprecise analysis of these multiparty protocols by reduction to our binary\ndomain-aware framework: complex domain-aware protocols can be reasoned about at\nthe right level of abstraction, ensuring also the principled transfer of key\ncorrectness properties from the binary to the multiparty setting.",

    "abstract": "Traditional power quality signal samples are based on the Nyquist sampling theory. Because of the existence of disturbance signal for the presence of power, it requires two times higher than the sampling frequency of the original signal, resulting in many problems, such as a high cost of hardware. Compressed sensing algorithm abandoned the characteristics of Shannon theorem, using a lower sampling frequency and the less amount of the signal to reconstruct the signal, with the method of a loss compression, which can effectively solve this problem. A team in Beijing University of Chemical Technology has done a deep research in this direction and proposed the total variation gradient reduction algorithm, which has good effects on reduction. But the algorithm runs slower and needs higher sample volumes of signal. Therefore, this paper presents a modified algorithm based on Nesta algorithm to reduce the amount of data sampled of power quality signal, the complexity of the algorithm to improve the algorithm\u2019s speed. The modified algorithm has a very important value in practical applications. This paper has carried out simulations in matlab, the results of the simulation show that this method is accurate and applied.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models have been widely used for studying thermal sensations. However, the black-box properties of machine learning models lead to the lack of model transparency, and existing explanations for the thermal sensation models are generally flawed in terms of the perspectives of interpretable methods. In this study, we perform an interpretability analysis using the \"SHapley Additive exPlanation\" (SHAP) from game theory for thermal sensation machine learning models. The effects of different features on thermal sensations and typical decision routes in the models are investigated from both local and global perspectives, and the properties of correlation between features and thermal sensations and decision routes within machine learning models are summarized. The differences in the effects of features across samples reflect the effects of features on thermal sensations not only can be demonstrated by significant magnitudes but also by differentiation. The effects of features on thermal sensations often appear in the form of combinations of two to four features, which determine the final thermal sensation in most cases. Therefore, the neutral environment may actually be a dynamic high-dimensional space consisting of certain combinations of features in certain ranges with changing shapes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract : Co-channel speaker interference occurs when the voice of one speaker is corrupted by the superposition of another speaker's voice on the same communications channel. The presence of co-channel interference in a communications scenario results in decreased intelligibility (for human listeners), both of the target speaker's speech as well as that of the interfering speaker. While humans can partially compensate for such interference, the performance of automatic speech processing systems, such as speech recognizers and speaker recognition systems, deteriorates drastically in the presence of such interference. This report describes a new methodology for speaker separation in the audio domain. This methodology is based on a frame-by-frame technique which is called the pole-partitioning separation algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Human speech perception is robust in the face of a wide variety of distortions, both experimentally applied and naturally occurring. In these conditions, state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology fails. This paper describes an approach to robust ASR which acknowledges the fact that some spectro-temporal regions will be dominated by noise. For the purposes of recognition, these regions are treated as missing or unreliable. The primary advantage of this viewpoint is that it makes minimal assumptions about any noise background. Instead, reliable regions are identified, and subsequent decoding is based on this evidence. We introduce two approaches for dealing with unreliable evidence. The first - marginalisation - computes output probabilities on the basis of the reliable evidence only. The second - state-based data imputation - estimates Values for the unreliable regions by conditioning on the reliable parts and the recognition hypothesis. A further source of information is the bounds on the energy of any constituent acoustic source in an additive mixture. This additional knowledge can be incorporated into the missing data framework. These approaches are applied to continuous-density hidden Markov model (HMM)-based speech recognisers and evaluated on the TIDigits corpus for several noise conditions. Two criteria which use simple noise estimates are employed as a means of identifying reliable regions. The first treats regions which are negative after spectral subtraction as unreliable. The second uses the estimated noise spectrum to derive local signal-to-noise ratios, which are then thresholded to identify reliable data points. Both marginalisation and state-based data imputation produce a substantial performance advantage over spectral subtraction alone. The use of energy bounds leads to a further increase in performance for both approaches. While marginalisation outperforms data imputation, the latter technique allows the technique to act as a preprocessor for conventional recognisers, or in speech-enhancement applications.

The purpose of the present study was to detect the presence of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) in HIV+ Venezuelan patients with periodontal disease. We evaluated GCE samples from 20 HIV+ patients with periodontal disease from the Infectious Disease Center, Faculty of Dentistry, Central University of Venezuela, and were clinically examined to establish their periodontal conditions, 13 under HAART (antiretroviral therapy) and 7 without HAART. Seven seronegative patients with chronic periodontitis and 7 seronegative patients, without periodontal disease were included. DNA extraction was performed, the consensus primers MY09 and MY11 for the HPV L1 region were used for PCR amplification. Genotipification was made for the 6, 11, 16, 18, 31 and 45 genotypes. HPV were detected in 46% of HIV+ patients under therapy. The CD4 cell counts in the HPV+ patients were not significantly different from the HPV-group. The viral load in the HPV+ group was significantly higher (200,470 +/- 324,244 copy/mL) than in the HPV- patients (10,246 +/- 23,805 copy/mL). Genotypes 6 and 11 were observed in the HPV positive samples, of which 4/6 (66.6%) presented coinfection with both types. No significant differences in the periodontal conditions were observed between patients with HPV-HIV infection related to patients with only HIV. HPV was detected only in the gingival crevicular fluid of HIV+ patients under HAART independently of the periodontal conditions.",

The deliverable first identifies the generic entities and concepts needed for specification of the three types of complex products addressed in GloNet, namely: the PV power plants, the intelligent buildings, and the future incubators. Then a set of generic meta-data is specified for representing data related to detailed configuration and ordering of these complex products. A class diagram is presented corresponding to this specification, within which a set of classes, their attributes, as well as the methods defined on the classes are specified. Both the functional and non-functional requirements of the aimed complex products are identified and analysed. Through analysing these requirements, a set of 21 use cases are designed. Furthermore, for each use case, its corresponding UML use case diagram and some textual description are provided. Then in the scope of the database design, a relational database schema is defined for managing all data in this system. Finally, a set of data manipulation services for the database system are designed, which will be implemented in the next task T4.2. As such, a number of representative abstractions of user interfaces are designed representing the base data manipulation functionalities and interactions of the user with the system. In the next step of WP4, during the task T4.2, the prototype of the database system addressed in T4.1, as well as its planned services will be implemented. This development aims at supporting the effective complex product specification, during its gradual process, and implements the design described in this deliverable.

Because monocular vision cannot obtain the depth information of the image, it cannot meet the accuracy requirements of pedestrian detection. In order to solve these problems, a new cascading pedestrian detection model based on PSMNet binocular information fusion and improved faster R-CNN pedestrian detection model is proposed. Firstly, binocular images are fed into the original PSMNet binocular information fusion module to get the disparity map, and then left and right images are fused by the disparity map to get the fusion image. Secondly, in the improved faster R-CNN pedestrian detection module, the left, right and fusion image of one frame are as separate inputs, and pedestrian detection is carried out respectively. Finally, the detection results of the three channels are passed through the target consistency validation module, and the verified pedestrian detection target is as the final output detection result.

In certain cases, choosing one over the other can substantially change the noise control approach on a project.

ILSP is equivalent to finding the closest lattice point to a given point and is known to be NP-hard. Sphere decoding (SD) is an effective method for solving the ILSP. In this paper, we mainly solve ILSP by the sphere decoding algorithm (SDA). One of the key issues in SDA is how to implement a more effective tree pruning strategy. In this paper a new definition for sphere radius is proposed as a tree pruning strategy to reduce the computational complexity. The core idea of our algorithm (K-SE-SD) is to sacrifice a relatively small reduction in accuracy to reduce relatively more time complexity.

    "abstract": "Publisher Summary This chapter presents a time-split difference scheme for solving the compressible Navier\u2013Stokes equations and describes the implementation of that scheme on the control data corporation STAR-100 vector processor. The scheme is vectorizable and suitable for pipeline processors. The computational grid is not rectangular; however, it is two rectangular regions joined along a part of one side. The scheme has been used to compute flows in two-dimensional and axisymmetric nozzles. The nozzles were either conventional converging\u2013diverging Laval nozzles or nozzles with suction slots located ahead of the throat. These computations aid in the design of the quiet wind tunnel being developed at National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ), Langley Research Center. A modification of this method has also been used to compute the flow at a wing-elevon junction. The difference scheme for the Navier\u2013Stokes equations is a time-split scheme with three splittings. One splitting encompasses the parabolic or viscous terms and two splittings are for the hyperbolic or inertial terms, one for each direction.",

    "abstract": "Because of their relative resistance to viral cytopathic effects, APC can provide an alternative reservoir for latently integrated HIV. We used an HIV-transgenic mouse model in which APC serve as the major source of inducible HIV expression to study mechanisms by which integrated virus can be activated in these cells. When admixed with transgenic APC, activated T lymphocytes provided a major contact-dependent stimulus for viral protein expression in vitro. Using blocking anti-CD154 mAb as well as CD154-deficient T cells, the HIV response induced by activated T lymphocytes was demonstrated to require CD40-CD154 interaction. The role of this pathway in the induction of HIV expression from APC in vivo was further studied in an experimental model involving infection of the HIV-transgenic mice with Plasmodium chabaudi parasites. Enhanced viral production by dendritic cells and macrophages in infected mice was associated with up-regulated CD40 expression. More importantly, in vivo treatment with blocking anti-CD154 mAb markedly reduced viral expression in P. chabaudi -infected animals. Together, these findings indicate that immune activation of integrated HIV can be driven by the costimulatory interaction of activated T cells with APC. Because chronic T cell activation driven by coinfections as well as HIV-1 itself is a characteristic of HIV disease, this pathway may be important in sustaining viral expression from APC reservoirs.",

Generally, the performance of a compression algorithm depends on its ability to anticipate the image function of the processed image. In other words, a compression algorithm to be successful, it has to take perfectly the advantage of coded image properties. Astronomical data form a special class of images and they have, among general image properties, also some specific characteristics which are unique. If a new coder is able to correctly use the knowledge of these special properties it should lead to its superior performance on this specific class of images at least in terms of the compression ratio.

However, not all social network data may identify the most influential customers. This empirical study of more than 300 students reveals the low explanatory power of friendship networks (e.g., Facebook) and undirected-advice networks (e.g., LinkedIn). Only directed-advice networks (e.g., Google +) clearly identify influential consumers. In addition, the results challenge conventional wisdom that firms should target advisers assuming that they have the strongest influence on new product adoption. This study contradicts this common assumption and reveals that structural equivalence drives product adoption more than cohesion because advisees' adoption pressures advisers to purchase the product as well.

    "abstract": "This study is about object matching, that is, a problem of locating the corresponding points of an object in an image. Conventional approaches to object matching are batch methods, meaning that the methods first learn the object model from a training set of example images that contain instances of the object, and then use the learned object model to match instances of the same object (or object class) in unseen test images. Such batch learning often leads to computationally heavy learning, at least when the images are incorporated sequentially into the system and large memory requirements. In computer vision, little work has been done in developing incremental object learners. Especially, an incremental object-matching method has \u2013 to the best knowledge of the authors \u2013 never been introduced. In this paper, the authors present such a method. Our technique finds the corresponding points of similar object instances, appearing in natural greyscale images with arbitrary location, scale and orientation, by processing the images sequentially. The approach is Bayesian and combines the shape and appearance of the corresponding points into the posterior distribution for the location of them. The posterior distribution is recursively sampled with particle filters to locate the most probable corresponding point sets in the image being processed. The results indicate that the matched corresponding points can be used in forming a representation of the object with which instances of the object in novel test images are successfully detected.",

In this paper, we propose a novel multi-locality correlation feature learning algorithm for multi-view data, called multi-locality discrimination canonical correlation analysis (MLDCCA), which can learn nonlinear correlation features with strong discriminative power. Different from the locality-based methods, our algorithm not only employs multiple local patches of each raw data to well capture the intrinsic geometrical structure information, but also fully considers intraclass scatter information for further enhancing the class separability of the learned correlation features. Extensive experimental results on several real-word image datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our algorithm.",

    "title": "Ensuring Minimum Spectrum Requirement in Matching-Based Spectrum Allocation",
    "abstract": "To enable dynamic spectrum access, service providers with spare spectrum (sellers) trade with those who are in need of additional spectrum (buyers). In a spectrum market, the transaction result is essentially a matching between sellers and buyers. Though it is tempting to optimize the matching over certain utility functions, a stable matching is more desirable, since no participants have incentives to deviate from the matching result. Existing spectrum matching algorithms only consider the maximum number of channels a buyer can purchase, but ignore minimum spectrum requirement that is essential to support proper operation of wireless communications. In this paper, we present a new framework of spectrum matching with both maximum quota and minimum requirements. Different from conventional matching problems, the spectrum market poses distinctive challenges due to spectrum reusability. To tackle this problem, we design two novel algorithms that satisfy different stability criterion: Extended Deferred Acceptance (EDA) algorithm that is fair but wasteful and the Multistage Deferred Acceptance (MDA) algorithm that is non-wasteful but weakly fair. Both algorithms converge to an interference-free matching and guarantees the minimum spectrum requirement. The simulation results show that the two proposed algorithms can raise buyer happiness and the channel utilization.",

This article considers the possibility that using secondary diagnoses extracted from hospital medical records of patients would modify the diagnosis related groups (DRG) allocated to a case and the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI)calculated from data in the Brazilian hospital information system.\r\nDesign. This study used two databases: the administrative database of the Brazilian health care system which consists of c1aim forms abstracted from medical records and is primarily linked to reimbursement, and the medical records that correspond to a sample of c1aims forms of which the first data source is composed. Changes in DRG were tested by analyzing percent of agreement and the K index. Logistic regression was employed to evaluate the impact of using CCI\r\nscores.\r\nSettings and patients. This study is based on a sample of c1aim forms and medical records (n = 1331) from a number of private acute-care hospitaIs which had contracts with the municipality of Rio de Janeiro in 1986.\r\nResults. Use of information on comorbidity shown in medical records caused changes both in the c1assification of cases into DRG and in the scores of the CCI. The impact of restrictions on the number of secondary diagnoses in the Brazilian administrative database is comparatively more important for the ccr than for DRG aIlocation since the Charlson method is based on an additional mode! where every case of comorbidity is taken into account cumulatively for the final score.\r\nConclusion.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Mackenzie, Hancock and Brown (1977) had used cylindrical tension bars and circumferentially notched tension bars to study the influence of the state of stress on ductile failure. Their experimental investigation concluded that in high strength steels the plastic strain which initiated failure was strongly dependent on the state of stress. Similar tests were done by Hur, Sun and Francois (1983) and other authors (e.g., those introduced in their references) to study void initiation criteria at inclusions. In this paper, we choose to investigate a low carbon low alloy steel. Axisymmetric specimens (cylindrical and notched ones) were made for tests to estimate the effects of triaxial stress on the development of two orders of voids. The mechanical condition, that initiated the second order of voids, was obtianed by the results of using scanning electron microscope (SEM) examination associated with computer simulation technique. The importance of accounting for the interaction between the two orders of voids is demonstrated. The plastic material parameters, which include the ductile microstructural damage, are determined for the constitutive equations which can be applied to ductile fracture analysis.",

    "abstract": "Background and Purpose: Signal transducer and activator of transcription3(STAT3) is a transcription factor that can be activated by various cytokines and growthfactors and mediates the expression of a variety of important genes responsible for cellproliferation, cell cycle progress, cell survival, angiogenesis and migration. STAT3hasbeen found to be overexpressed in many human cancers including solid tumor cancerssuch as lung cancer, breast cancer and prostate cancer. In hematological malignancies,STAT3has been reported in leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma (MM). STAT3is closely related to the pathogenesis and development of malignant tumors. Tumor cellscan be induced apoptosis if STAT3activity is inhibited. Recent studies have beendemonstrated that blocking the STAT3signaling pathway can overcome drug resistancein retinoblastoma, lung cancer, leukemia and other tumors. In the present study, weidentified a novel small chemical compound Kifocitanib that inhibits the activity ofSTAT3in multiple myeloma. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determinewhether Kifocitanib can induce MM cell death and to find out the underlyingmechanisms.\nMethods:\n(1) Trypan blue exclusion assay was used to analyse the effects of Kifocitanib oncell viability and proliferation in multiple myeloma cells.\n(2) Flow cytometry was used to measure the effects of Kifocitanib on cellapoptosis and cell cycle in myeloma cells.\n(3) Western blotting was performed to examine the expression of proteins thatinvolved in cell apoptosis, cell cycle and STAT3signaling pathway.\n(4) Immunofluorescence assay was used to determine the cell expression ofp-STAT3and cellular localization in RPMI-8226cells.\n(5) Cell scratch assay was used to evaluate the effect of Kifocitanib on cellmigration in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC).\n(6)A myeloma xenograft experiment was used to detect the effect of Kifocitanib ontumor growth in vivo.\nResults:\n(1) Kifocitanib inhibited the growth of multiple myeloma cells. We found that KIFinhibited cell viability and proliferation of multiple myeloma cells in a dose dependentmanner.\n(2) Kifocitanib induced multiple myeloma cells apoptosis. We analysed cellapoptosis by Annexin V-FITC and PI staining and found that the percentage of apoptoticcells raised in a concentration-dependent manner after the drug treatment. The results ofWestern blotting showed that Kifocitanib activated caspase-3, caspase-9and PARP.\n(3) Kifocitanib arrested MM cells at the G0/G1phase of the cell cycle. We detectedthe expression of proteins involved in cell cycle, including Cyclins, CDK4/6, E2F-1andp-RB. The results showed a dose dependent inhibition by Kifocitanib. And the flowcytometry result demonstrated that the percentage of cells at G0/G1phase was raised ina dose dependent manner.\n(4) Kifocitanib suppressed the activation of STAT3. We found that Kifocitanib notonly inhibited the constitutive STAT3phosphorylation, but also suppressed the IL-6\u2013activated STAT3signals. Immunofluorescence analysis also showed that it decreasedthe expression of STAT3phosphorylation in RPMI-8226cells. In the myeloma\u2013stromalmicroenvironment, we found Kifocitanib inhibited STAT3activation.\n(5) Kifocitanib blocked the nuclear STAT3export. We isolated the nuclear andcytosol fractions for STAT3analysis. The results showed that the expression levels ofSTAT3in nuclei were increased after drug treatment under both complete medium orstarved conditions.\n(6) Kifocitanib inhibited the STAT3signaling pathway. We detected the upstreamand downstream events in the STAT3signal by Western blotting. And the resultsdemonstrated that Kifocitanib not only inhibited the JAK2and c-Src phosphorylation,but also decreased the expression of Mcl-1, Bcl-2, CCND2, and VEGF.\n(7) Kifocitanib inhibited cell migration. The cell scratching assay demonstratedthat Kifocitanib inhibited cell migration in human umbilical vein endothelial cells(HUVEC).\n(8) Kifocitanib delayed tumor growth in a MM xenograft model. We established ahuman myeloma xenograft model. By daily monitoring of tumor sizes and body weight, we found that Kifocitanib markedly decreased tumor growth without significant loseweight within14-day treatment.\nConclusion: In the present study, we demonstrate that Kifocitanib induces cellapoptosis and arrests cell cycle by inhibiting STAT3activity. Our date suggest thatKifocitanib may be appromising candidate for the treatment of multiple myeloma.  ",

    "abstract": "Abstract : Our objective in the Speech Technology Group of the User Interface Technology Branch at the Naval Ocean Systems Center (NOSC) in San Diego is to apply speech technology to naval command and control systems. By employing data bases and expert systems to aid in decision making, naval command and control systems are becoming more complex and sophisticated. The design of man-machine interfaces to these systems is critical to user acceptance and functionality. We believe that the use of speech recognition in many of these systems is not only possible, but vital to shipboard operations. This report addresses a number of important issues involving the implementation of continuous speech recognition for information-acquisition tasks. The following questions are addressed: 1) For a restricted information acquisition task such as database query, what can be considered natural speech?, 2) How can the syntax be constrained to improve accuracy but at the same time still allow natural speech?, 3) How effectively can feedback be used to shape or influence the user's speech? Can the user adapt to a limited vocabulary and restricted syntax?, 4) For an appropriate task, can a continuous speech recognizer configured as a word spotter be used to partially remove syntax restrictions? An information acquisition experiment is described. Results are presented and user interaction and reaction are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The evaluation of bio-sensor signals often needs to happen live, e.g. within seconds after capturing new values. Sometimes new data is generated from one or more single sensor signals. If a long trend of these values is of interest, it is important to automatically ignore unwanted anomalies or distortions in the sensor signals.

    "title": "A Study of Thermal Load of Tread Braking for Metro Wheel",
    "abstract": "Wheel is an important load-bearing component of metro. The service reliability of wheels is closely related to the safe operation of the metro. Wheel tread braking is one of the main braking modes of metro braking. During the operation, the loads applied on the wheels not only include the wheel-rail contact force, but also the braking thermal loads in the frequent braking process when the wheel acts as a friction pair. So the working conditions of wheels are very poor. Therefore the study of thermal load of tread braking for metro wheel is significant for the optimal designs of metro braking program, the wheel/brake shoe matching and the wheel structure.\nThe main works in this thesis are as follows:\n(1) A3-D finite element thermal analysis model is built by commercial software ANSYS, which takes into account the characteristics of the material parameters changing with temperature. Comparative analysis of the effects of the two heat flux load application methods and the time step size on the transient temperature field results. The result shows: the uniform heat method is more appropriate. Besides the influence of wheel-rail contact heat transfer on the wheel temperature field during the braking process has been analyzed to verify the calculation model that used in the paper is feasible.\n(2) The distribution of transient temperature field and stress field of wheels during the wheel braking which is realized, respectively, by using only the tread brake, by electric and air mixed brake mode, are studied in the typical operating conditions of metro. Then the wheel tread damage is assessed based on the related wheel tread damage evaluation criteria. The result shows that it is better to choose the electro-pneumatic compound brake method when the metro operating line is too long.\n(3) The effect of the brake shoe's materials and transversal width, axle load and deceleration on the thermal capacity of the vehicle during braking processes are analyzed through the result comparison at different operational speeds. And their effects on the metro braking performance are also studied. The result shows:in order to ensure the vehicle braking performance to meet the requirements of the tread, good thermal conductivity and lateral width moderate brake shoe should be chosen, while not using excessive deceleration.\n(4)Three kinds of finite element wheel models that having different plate structure are built up\u3002Then to calculate the thermal stress value of the three kinds of wheels under the same braking conditions and the mechanical stress curve under the corresponding mechanical load conditions. Then the stress superposition under thermal and mechanical loads is done by a certain method. Finally we assess the fatigue strength of three wheels based on Haigh-Goodman fatigue limit curve. The result shows:the S-spokes wheel has the best fatigue resistance in the three wheels. Therefore, the optimal design of the new wheel spokes recommended to choose the form of S-shaped spokes.  ",

This code is constructed using code segment and data segment. One of the important properties of this code is that the cross correlation at data segment is always zero, which means that Phase Intensity Induced Noise (PIIN) is reduced. For the performance analysis, the effects of phase-induced intensity noise, shot noise, and thermal noise are considered simultaneously. Bit-error rate (BER) performance is compared with Hadamard and Modified Frequency Hopping (MFH) codes. It is shown that the system using this new code matrices not only suppress PIIN, but also allows larger number of active users compare with other codes. Simulation results shown that using point to point transmission with three encoded channels, RD code has better BER performance than other codes, also its found that at 0 dbm PIIN noise are 10 -10 and 10 -11 for RD and MFH codes respectively.",

    "abstract": "The contents of most databases are ever-changing, and erroneous data can be a significant problem in real-world databases. Therefore, the process of discovering knowledge from databases is a process based on incipient hypothesis generation/evaluation and refinement/management. Although many systems for knowledge discovery in databases have been proposed, most systems have not addressed the capabilities of refining/managing the discovered knowledge. This paper describes a hierarchical model learning approach for refining/managing concept clusters discovered from databases. This approach is the basic one for developing HML (Hierarchical Model Learning), which is one sub-system of our GLS (Global Learning Scheme) discovery system and can be cooperatively used with other sub-systems of GLS such as DBI (Decomposition Based Induction). By means of HML, concept clusters discovered from a database by DBI can be represented as the Multi-Layer Logic formulae with hierarchical models in a knowledge-base and can be easily refined/managed according to data change in a database and/or domain knowledge. HML is based on the model representation of Multi-Layer Logic (MLL). Its key feature is the quantitative evaluation for selecting the best representation of the MLL formulae by using cooperatively a criterion based on information theory and domain knowledge. Experience with a prototype of HML implemented by the knowledge-based system KAUS is discussed.",

Methods C3H10T1 /2 cells were infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing BMP9,while the essential canonical Wnt signaling mediatorbeta-catenin was over-expressed by Ad-beta-catenin,and the knock-down of beta-catenin expression was achieved by adenovirus- mediated siRNA specific for beta-catenin. The C3H10T1 /2 cells were analyzed for activity of alkaline phosphatase(ALP), for transcription levels of osteopontin(OPN)and osteocalcin(OC)mRNAs by RT-PCR,and for calcium deposition by alizarin red S staining. Results BMP9 alone induced the osteogenic differentiation of C3H10T1 /2 cells and increased the ALP activity. However,beta-catenin alone induced no osteogenic differentiation,while increased the BMP9-induced ALP activity in a dose-dependent pattern,and promoted the OPN and OC mRNA transcriptions and calcium deposition induced by BMP9. The inhibition of beta-catenin expression decreased the ALP activity in C3H10T1 /2 cells induced by BMP9(P < 0. 05),down-regulated the transcription levels of OPN and OC mRNAs and inhibited the calcium deposition.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a method to synthesize multi-view video frames to facilitate coding and transmission of patient monitoring video. The synthesis is carried out in the DCT domain by means of interlacing. The synthesized video provides a higher video coding efficiency, better synchronization of the video streams from multiple cameras, as well as the improved data loss resilience and protection of the video content. The viability of the presented method was demonstrated by experimental results on patient monitoring video. I. INTRODUCTION IDEO recording via multiple cameras has become a popular practice for many applications. Patient monitoring, for example, is directly benefited from this technology. In this application, the patient images are recorded from different viewpoints at the same time to reduce occlusions. However, an immediate issue raised from multi-camera recording is the video coding scheme for both archiving and transmission purposes. Coding the multiple video streams independently can be a tremendous waste of bandwidth, and the synchronization of these streams may also be problematic. Research has been conducted targeting multi-view video coding. A variety of methods have been proposed based on free viewpoint video communications(1)(2), using a hierarchical light field to facilitate immersive viewing (3), and using a wavelet-based codec to improve rate-distortion performance (4). These previous works were either intended to utilize the MPEG-2/MPEG-4/H264 multi-view profile to achieve higher compression efficiency, or tried to formulate a new coding structure specifically designed for multi-view images. In these methods, the video frames from different cameras are cross-referenced and the disparities between them are explicitly utilized to reduce the redundancies between cameras. The resulting approach in this respect can be highly complex in its implementation, and requires accurate disparity maps that are often hard to obtain. Against the backdrop of these concerns, we explore a \"mono-view\" coding scheme that codes multi-view video frames after synthesizing the views into a single image. The regular video codecs can be directly applied to the synthesized video frames. Additionally, by using this method, the synchronization problem regarding the multiple cameras is automatically resolved, and the reconstructed images are more resilient to certain losses of data during transmission. This scheme is accomplished by synthesizing patient monitoring video frames in a transform domain. These video frames, recording the same patient from different viewpoints, possess common features in the frequency domain. Therefore, we employ a DCT-coefficient interlacing technique to synthesize the frames without requiring an accurate geometric mapping between the cameras. In addition, this process rearranges the contents contained in the multiple images, achieving an improved content protection. We have conducted experiments of this method using patient monitoring video clips.",

    "abstract": "With the development of economy, enrichment of atmospheric greenhouse gases,mainly carbon dioxide, resulted from human activities has increased global meantemperature. Because most of the carbon dioxide is emitted from coal-fired power plantsand about80%of global energy supply will still rely on fossil fuels in the future, the studieson CO_2capture from the flue gas are very important.\nThe main components in the flue gas are CO_2and N_2, so the separation between CO_2and N_2is the key. The methods so far presented for the capture of flue gas CO_2includesbsoption, adsorption, membrane separation and the separation at low temperature. Thechemical absorption of CO_2with aqueous solutions of amines is presently the mosteconomical one, but there are some problems with equipment corrosion, amine lost andhigh-energy cost. The adsorption method bearing advantange in simple equipment,low-energy cost, wide range of pressure and temperature has been the most potentialmethod for the CO_2capture.\nThe adsorbent is the core of adsorption, which determines the separation performance.So the paper studied the separation coefficients of twelve adsorbents, and the influences oftemperature, surface polarity, specific surface area and pore size on the separationperformance are presented, firstly.\nBecause CO_2could be adsorbed with the occurrence of multi-layer adsorption andcapillary condensation, while N_2adsorbed with the single molecular adsorption undernormal temperature, so the researches on whether the change of adsorption mechanismcould enhance the separation performance of CO_2and N_2under high pressures areobservated.\nSecondly, in order to enhance the separation performances of adsorbent, adsorbentsSG-A and SG-B are modified with different amines.

Micronucleus assay and mitotic index were selected to achieve this purpose. A second series of blood samples was taken 8 months after the workers were removed from agricultural field to detect DNA repair in lymphocytes of the same subjects. Regardless of the sampling time the exposed workers showed an increased number of micronucleus (MN) frequency. After 8 months of non-exposure the workers showed a significantly decreased number of MN frequency compared to the results of the first sampling, but it was still significantly higher than the controls indicating a possible risk of cytogenetic damage for the exposed group. Besides that, malathion and chlorpyrifos lowered the mitotic index in peripheral lymphocyte cells of the exposed subjects.",

The scenario-based approach adopted for this study feature the following two variables. The first variable is the development over the North Korean issues between the United States and China while the second variable relies on the advances in the North Korean legislative system for the improvement of inter-Korean relations. The analysis of these variables is aimed at estimating the possibility of regime transitions in North Korea and the prospective integrations of the North and South Korean legislative systems and helping establish the policies for the South Korean government. Amid the fast-changing global diplomatics and the dynamics in Northeast Asia, the for major neighboring powers and South Korea will wield large direct and indirect influences on North Korea. As the changes in North Korea will have significant impacts on Northeast Asia and the world as well, the six-party talks for the resolution of North Korean nuclear strife will be a significantly important variable. For this study, four different scenarios - Scenario I (Globalization of North Korean legislation), Scenario II (Partial adoption of South Korea's advanced legislation), Scenario III (Defense of 'North Korean socialism legislation'), and Scenario IV (Building relations with the US and China by blocking South Korea) - were set up to forecast the upcoming decade. The scenario-based approach will suggest a wide variety of possibilities in the regime transitions of North Korea. Based on such scenarios, this study will discuss the policy issues for the South Korean government and the directions for the integration of North and South Korean legislative systems.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present efficient, high-quality volume rendering techniques for large volume datasets using graphics processing units (GPUs). We employ the 3D texture mapping capability commonly available in modern GPUs as a core rendering engine and take advantage of combinations of HW-supported occlusion queries, stencil tests and programmable shaders to accelerate the whole rendering process. As a preprocessing step, we subdivide the entire volume data-set into a union of subvolumes of a uniform size. For each subvolume, we also create a filtered visible subvolumes (FVS). The FVS is defined as a set of subvolumes that contain the visible voxels. Before executing an interactive rendering loop, using FVS, we find the boundary subvolumes that are closest to the bounding planes enclosing the entire volume data, and pre-fetch them from main memory to texture memory as they are likely to be rendered regardless of the change of a viewpoint. Then, by rendering the boundary subvolumes onto stencil buffer, we create an initial occlusion map. At runtime, as we render each subvolume, the occlusion map is updated accordingly. Moreover, using the occlusion map, we issue a series of HW-supported occlusion queries to cull away occluded subvolumes and also perform an early ray termination based on the stencil test. We have implemented the volume rendering algorithm and, for a large volume data of 512 x 512 x 1024 dimensions, we achieve real-time performance (i.e., 2 similar to 3 FPS) on a Pentium IV 2.8 GHz PC equipped with ATI 9800Pro graphics card with 256MB video memory and 256MB AGP memory without any loss of image quality.",

Fourier phase retrieval is required during the imaging process by means of numerical computations using computers. However, it is difficult to establish a complete convergence using an incomplete diffraction pattern such as experimental data in the retrieving process. A simple averaging procedure by weak phase -retrieved results using different initials is often used. Recently, the spherical shell structure of the retrieved images has been investigated and the center of the shell is to be a superior retrieved result. Therefore, it is important to construct such a structure by the retrieved images in order to reconstruct the target image. In this paper, a novel sequential on-line algorithm for effectively constructing the spherical shell structure of the images is introduced.

This work advocates using Kullback-Leibler distance (KLD) to track DOS and DDOS flooding attacks, including SYN flood, UDP flood, and Smurf attacks. The proposed mechanism's key novelty is the amalgamation of the desirable characteristics of KLD with the sensitivity of an exponential smoothing algorithm. Notably, the use of exponentially smoothing is expected to improve the detector sensitivity to small anomalies. Besides, the proposed mechanism does not need knowledge about data distribution.

We propose a flexible and light-weight hardware/software co-design approach to perform DIFT based on secure page allocation. Instead of associating every data with a taint tag, we aggregate data according to their taints, i.e., putting data with different attributes in separate memory pages. Our approach is a compiler-aided process with architecture support. The implementation and analysis show that the memory overhead is little, and our approach can protect critical information, including return address, indirect jump address, and system call IDs, from being overwritten by malicious users.",

Outside of the context of a clinical trial, the treatments are used sequentially. We describe results under real-life conditions of a sequential treatment strategy, before the era of immunotherapy. All patients were treated according to their prognostic score (either Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center or International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium) for advanced renal cell carcinoma. A treatment strategy involving 1 to 4 lines was determined including a rechallenge criterion for the repeat use of a treatment class. Three hundred forty-four patients were included over 3 years. Overall survival was 57\u2009months in patients with good or intermediate prognosis and 19\u2009months in patients with poor prognosis. In the former group, the proportions of patients treated with 2 to 4 treatment lines were 70%, 38% and 16%, respectively. The best objective response rates for lines 1 to 4 were 46%, 36%, 16% and 17%, respectively. Grade III/IV toxicity did not appear to be cumulative. The recommended strategy was followed in 68% of patients. A large proportion of patients with good or intermediate prognosis who progress after two lines of treatment still have a performance status good enough to receive a systemic treatment, which justifies such a strategy. Overall survival of patients with good and intermediate prognosis was long, suggesting a benefit from the applied approach.

The usual algorithms to solve this problem are picking points on the patches to get Lagrange's data or trying to get local junctions on patches. But the first method does not use the continuous aspect of the data and the second one does not perform well to get a global regular approximant (C-1 or more). As an approximant of f, a discrete smoothing spline belonging to a suitable piecewise polynomial space is proposed. The originality of the method consists in the fidelity criterion used to fit the data, which takes into account their particular aspect (surface's patches): the idea is to define a function that minimizes the volume located between the data patches and the function and which is globally C-k.

The research results presented here form part of the overall initiative and focus on the development of a set of guiding principles for companies seeking to implement appropriate CAPM systems. The research team have identified three key elements that must be considered when implementing a CAPM system. First, that CAPM implementation can be eased if the overall manufacturing-system is first simplified. Second, we recognize that even then most companies will still require a computerized solution thus any methodology must include a software specification. Third, the overall performance of the system may be enhanced by changes to the infrastructure that supports the software. In attempting to meet these requirements the research team developed a four-stage methodology.

    "title": "In situ evidence of involvement of Schwann cells in ulcerative colitis: autocrine and paracrine signaling by A disintegrin and metalloprotease-17-mediated tumor necrosis factor alpha production",
    "abstract": "An increase in S 100 protein-positive cells has been reported in inflammatory bowel diseases, mainly Crohn disease. These cells were interpreted as myeloid-derived dendritic cells, chiefly in follicular areas. We were prompted to assess the nature of these cells in interfollicular areas of inflamed colonic mucosa in ulcerative colitis and study their involvement in tumor necrosis factor alpha production, the main inflammatory cytokine in ulcerative colitis. The number and distribution of cells expressing S100 protein, nerve growth factor receptor, CD68, CD1a, CD83, and calretinin were studied in samples from 16 patients with active ulcerative colitis using simple and double immunohistochemistry. Then, the localization in S 100 protein-positive cells of (1) tumor necrosis factor alpha, (2) its sheddase A disintegrin and metalloprotease-17, and (3) the receptors TNFR1 was assessed using double immunofluorescence followed by confocal microscopy. In active ulcerative colitis, there was an increased number in S100 protein-positive cells in interfollicular areas of colonic mucosa compared with quiescent ulcerative colitis, nonulcerative colitis, or normal mucosa. All S100 protein-positive cells ensheathed calretinin-positive axons, indicating their Schwann cell origin. No CD1a- or CD83-positive dendritic cells were detected. Double immunofluorescence studies showed that in normal colon, Schwann cells of the mucosa and submucosal plexuses weakly expressed A disintegrin and metalloprotease-17 but did not express tumor necrosis factor alpha. By contrast, in active ulcerative colitis, they expressed both A disintegrin and metalloprotease-17 and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Schwann cells as well as calretinin-positive axons strongly expressed TNFR1. This study shows (1) a Schwann cell proliferation in the inflamed colonic mucosa during active ulcerative colitis and (2) that Schwann cells produce tumor necrosis factor a. Tumor necrosis factor a is thus likely to stimulate Schwann cell proliferation through an autocrine/paracrine mechanism. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\nInformation system developers have to cope with a continually changing technological landscape. Knowing what each kind of technique or technology can do and how well they perform under various conditions constitute an important kind of know-how that systems professionals seek. In this paper, we claim that such know-how information can be structured as a map, so as to facilitate understanding and decision making about what technology to adopt or develop. Recent work has proposed to use a goal-oriented approach to address the challenge of constructing such a map. In this paper, we examine the hypothesis that a goal-oriented approach can be used for mapping and analyzing technological domains. First, we apply the approach to several domains, to verify the applicability and expressiveness of the approach. Second, we perform a feature-based analysis and examine the extent to which the approach addresses the desired characteristics of a know-how map. Third, we conduct a controlled experiment in which the comprehension of goal-oriented know-how maps in comparison to a textual summary from a literature review was examined. The evaluation results indicate that the goal-oriented know-how maps have sufficient expressiveness, are easy to read and understand, and address a number of desired characteristics.",

    "abstract": "A novel stimulator was developed to examine the contribution of diaphragmatic failure to the toxicity of cholinesterase inhibitors. The hardware consisted of a laboratory computer equipped with an analog input/output board. The pulses were generated by a computer program written in Fortran-77 and assembly language and were amplified to the range required for nerve stimulation by an operational amplifier in a voltage follower configuration. The salient feature of the stimulator was its ability to produce diaphragmatic contractions where increases in firing frequency and motor unit recruitment occur simultaneously during each inspiratory cycle. This method has been designated as \"contour stimulation\" to distinguish it from conventional repetitive stimulation where pulse amplitudes and frequencies are fixed for each train. When tested on in vitro preparations of rat diaphragm muscle during physostigmine-induced cholinesterase blockade, both conventional and contour stimulation led to marked tetanic fade. However, contour pulses that were amplitude modulated produced less fade than those generated by conventional repetitive stimulation.",

Computer science and engineering have, in comparison to other areas, focused on abstraction and technology, chasing the ever-changing artifacts, namely, computer and communication hardware and software.

The trend in this decade is \u201czero-mania\u201d by focusing on minimization of power consumption, downtime, time-to-market, etc. The result is that the time for modeling, measurements and assessment is limited and once some hypotheses are verified in part, they frequently become obsolete due new technologies, environments and applications.

They are mostly based on local image features, therefore feature detection, description and matching are crucial for their efficient operations. The aim of this study was to investigate the most popular feature detection and description algorithms such as SIFT, SURF, FAST, STAR, HARRIS, ORB, BRISK and FREAK. Additionally, the image correction technique was presented and image enhancement methods were analysed in order to increase efficiency of image features matching.

    "abstract": "As space mission software systems become larger and more complex, it is increasingly important for the software assurance effort to have the ability to effectively assess both the artifacts produced during software system development and the development process itself. Conceptually, assurance is a straightforward idea - it is the result of activities carried out by an organization independent of the software developers to better inform project management of potential technical and programmatic risks, and thus increase management's confidence in the decisions they ultimately make. In practice, effective assurance for large, complex systems often entails assessing large, complex software artifacts (e. g., requirements specifications, architectural descriptions) as well as substantial amounts of unstructured information (e. g., anomaly reports resulting from testing activities during development). In such an environment, assurance engineers can benefit greatly from appropriate tool support. In order to do so, an assurance organization will need accurate and timely information on the tool support available for various types of assurance activities. In this paper, we investigate the current use of tool support for assurance organizations within NASA, and describe on-going work at JPL for providing assurance organizations with the information about tools they need to use them effectively.",

    "abstract": "Performance of the Kalman filter (KF) is degraded when dealing with nonlinear dynamic systems. For a kind of nonlinear biomechatronics system, a fifth-degree ensemble iterated cubature square-root information filter (EsFICIF), which can effectively improve estimation performance, is proposed by combing many estimation schemes. Moreover, the associated multisensor fusion is deeply studied based on this proposed nonlinear filter in this paper. That is, four classic nonlinear fusion methods, which include augmented measurements fusion, weighted measurements fusion, sequential filtering fusion, and distributed filtering fusion, are compared on estimation performance. The motivation of this paper is to extend the work on estimation performance comparison of nonlinear fusion methods based on the conventional extended KF and to validate some basic conclusions existed in the traditional linear data fusion theory based on the proposed EsFICIF. The estimation accuracies of the four nonlinear fusion methods are compared and the exchanging property of measurements update order is also discussed. It is observed that, when the measurement properties are identical, the estimation accuracies of augmented measurements fusion, weighted measurements fusion, and distributed feedback fusion are equivalent, while the sequential filtering fusion does not hold. Furthermore, the exchanging property of the measurements update order of the sequential filtering fusion can no longer be guaranteed. These results further show some basic conclusions existed in linear fusion theory are no longer valid for nonlinear systems and the conclusions based on the EKF are still available for more complex nonlinear filters. Finally, numerical examples are provided to validate the results given in this paper.",

Firstly, the system's mode transition model based on CPN (Mode Transition CPN, MTCPN) is designed on the basis of the mode transition specification of on-board subsystem. Secondly, in order to avoid state space explosion and endless loop of the MTCPN model, test target sequences of mode transition based on the Chinese Postman Algorithm are generated to drive simulation execution of the MTCPN model.

    "abstract": "Cattle in a hot climate have 2 peak grazing times, early morning and late afternoon, so feeding a supplement in early morning may interfere with pasture consumption. A controlled-release urea may synchronize ruminal ammonia and energy availability compared with urea. The objective of this study was to evaluate the ingestive behavior of grazing cattle in the dry season at a low latitude, receiving supplements containing urea or Optigen (a controlled-release urea) at 0700 or 1300 h. One hundred twenty young Nellore bulls with BW of 228 \u00b1 39 kg and 12 mo old were used, 5 in each of 20 paddocks of 3 ha each. The pasture was Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu. The duration was 98 d, 14 d of adaptation and 3 periods of 28 d. The grazing time and the time at the supplement trough during daytime (0600 to 1750 h), nighttime (1800 to 0550 h), and total were evaluated by trained people at 10-min intervals on 1 d in each period. The 4 treatments were a factorial design of 2 feeding times \u00d7 2 urea sources, applied in a randomized complete block design. Statistical analysis was by the MIXED procedure of SAS, version 9.2 (SAS, 2008), considering block as a random variable. There was no influence of supplementation time, urea sources, or their interaction on the grazing time or the trough time during daytime, nighttime or total (P > 0.10). The grazing time was reduced by 92 min (P < 0.01) in the third period compared with the first 2 and the trough time was lower in the first period (33 min; P = 0.03) than in the second (50 min) and the third (65 min), but there were no interactions of period with treatment.

Among them are powerful gyrotrons for electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) and current drive (ECCD) of magnetically confined plasma in various reactors for controlled thermonuclear fusion (e.g., tokamaks and most notably ITER), high-frequency gyrotrons for sub-terahertz spectroscopy (for example NMR-DNP, XDMR, study of the hyperfine structure of positronium, etc.), gyrotrons for thermal processing and so on. Modelling and simulation are indispensable tools for numerical studies, computer-aided design (CAD) and optimization of such sophisticated vacuum tubes (fast-wave devices) operating on a physical principle known as electron cyclotron resonance maser (ECRM) instability. During the recent years, our research team has been involved in the development of physical models and problem-oriented software packages for numerical analysis and CAD of different gyrotrons in the framework of a broad international collaboration. In this paper we present the current status of our simulation tools (GYROSIM and GYREOSS packages) and illustrate their functionality by results of numerical experiments carried out recently.

    "abstract": "Objective To investigate the fused expression of secreted protein CFP10-ESAT-6 or EAST-6-CFP10 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and to study their immunological characteristics, and their potential for serodiagnosis of tuberculosis. Methods A pair of oligodeoxynucleotide named linker encoding 12 glycines and 3 serines was synthesized and cloned into plasmid pET32c(+) to construct pET32c(+)-linker. The CFP10 and ESAT-6 genes were amplified by PCR reaction and cloned into pET32c(+)-linker either ahead of or following linker. The recombinant CFP10-ESAT-6 or EAST-6-CFP10 fusion protein was expressed in E.coli BL21. Their antigenicities were confirmed by Western blot. The potential value of the fusion proteins was evaluated in the diagnosis of tuberculosis with sera of tuberculosis patients. Results The sequence of recombinant plasmid pET32c(+)- CFP10-ESAT-6 or pET32c(+)-EAST-6-CFP10 was identical to the predicted sequence. The recombinant protein (rCFP10-ESAT-6 or rEAST-6-CFP10), about 26 000, existed in the cytoplasm BL21. Western blot showed that the rCFP10-ESAT-6 or rEAST-6-CFP10 had good immuoreactivity with sera from patients with active tuberculosis.

    "abstract": "Traditional seismic inversion (SI) maps the hundreds of terabytes of raw-field data to subsurface properties in gigabytes.  This inversion process is expensive, requiring over a year of human and computational effort. Recently, data-driven approaches equipped with Deep learning (DL) are envisioned to improve SI efficiency.  However, these improvements are restricted to data with highly reduced scale and complexity. To extend these approaches to real-scale seismic data, researchers need to process raw nav-merge seismic data into an image and perform convolution. We argue that this convolution-based way of SI is not only computationally expensive but also conceptually problematic. Seismic data is not naturally an image and need not be processed as images. In this work, we go beyond convolution and propose a novel SI method. We solve the scalability of SI by proposing a new auxiliary learning paradigm for SI (Aux-SI). This paradigm breaks the SI into local inversion tasks, which predicts each small chunk of subsurface properties using surrounding seismic data. Aux-SI combines these local predictions to obtain the entire subsurface model. However, even this local inversion is still challenging due to: (1) high-dimensional, spatially irregular multi-modal seismic data, (2) there is no concrete spatial mapping (or alignment) between subsurface properties and raw data. To handle these challenges, we propose an all-MLP architecture,  Multi-Modal Information Unscrambler (MMI-Unscrambler), that unscrambles seismic information by ingesting all available multi-modal data. The experiment shows that MMI-Unscrambler outperforms both SOTA U-Net and Transformer models on simulation data. We also scale MMI-Unscrambler to raw-field nav-merge data on Gulf-of-Mexico to obtain a geologically sound velocity model with an SSIM score of 0.8. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful demonstration of the DL approach on SI for real, large-scale, and complicated raw field data. ",

In order to reduce the risk of the problem, the listed companies strictly require managers to disclose financial information, announcements, etc. The T year financial report of the listed companies always publish on the third or fifth year in T+1 year, then the majority information of the year report are always historical information, but the existence of time-delay problem of financial information is unable to meet the demand forecast of investors in the changing of the capital market. In order to meet the needs of investors for future financial information, the analyst come into being as a new industry, the securities analyst earnings forecast behavior is gradually increasing as well. From the perspective of the effectiveness of the capital market, the financial information of the listed company is an important source of information for managers and investors to make decisions, and earnings management is the important factors which affect the quality of financial information disclosure, as the means of manipulating earnings for listed companies, it triggered a series of management earnings manipulation.This article mainly from two aspects to conduct the research on the securities analyst earnings forecast accuracy, one is the relationship between research and audit institutions and their earnings forecast accuracy, and the second one is research based on the impact of corporate governance under the audit institutions and their earnings forecast accuracy relations.Firstly, this article summarizes the relevant literature at home and abroad on corporate governance, audit institutions, audit selection as well as earnings forecast accuracy, and the theme of this paper are based on the existing research contents and conclusions. The research hypothesis are put forward based on the principal-agent theory, transaction cost theory, asymmetric information theory, and they are verified from two aspects:firstly, after the selection of the sample, conducted an regression analysis of the data to examine the influence of the audit institutions on securities analyst earnings forecasts; secondly, based on the impact of corporate governance on audit institution, this article added another variable corporate governance as a variable to test the moderating effects of corporate governance on the relationship between audit selection and the prediction accuracy of securities analysts' earnings. Through the study of the relationship between the two external independent agencies and independent third party, this paper is dedicated to identify the financial information of the listed companies disclosure level, and then, to reveal the manipulate degree about the earnings of listed companies. At the same time, in order to know more about the relationship between the audit agency selection and the predict accuracy of the securities, the corporate governance was put forward as a moderating variable, and the relationship are verified by the empirical data of listed A-share companies from 2009 to 2014.Through empirical study it was found that in this paper:on the one hand, in comparison with the non-international four and non-domestic top six audit institutions, the audit institutions as independent third party organization, the four international or domestic top six audit institutions have competence advantage objectively, like the firm size, brand reputation, the abundant human resources so on. Furthermore, rather than non-international four big and before the big six CPA firms, the four big or the top six audit institutions have more professional team of auditors, and its industry expertise is easier to form scale effect.In general conclusion, the four international or domestic top six audit institutions can provide more comprehensive audit services, and the quality of the information disclosure on their financial report is relatively higher. If the listed companies choose four international or domestic top six as their audit institutions, the quality of information disclosure is much higher, accompanies with the lower manipulation degree of earnings as well as the higher accuracy of Securities analyst. On the other hand, the higher level of corporate governance will motivate the directors and management of the company board to achieve the interests of enterprises, and the perfect governance mechanism can also make them more confident about their management level. In consideration of reducing agency cost, increasing investor confidence as well as improving the company's overall value, the listed companies are always preferred to choose auditor team with large scale, abundant human client resources, high brand reputation as well as professional teams such as the four international or domestic top six major accounting firms. And then, the quality of financial information disclosure and the transparency of accounting information can be achieved to attract investors and increase the value of the whole enterprise.",

then the majority information of the year report are always historical information but the existence of timedelay problem of financial information is unable to meet the demand forecast of investors in the changing of the capital market in order to meet the needs of investors for future financial information the analyst come into being as a new industry the securities analyst earnings forecast behavior is gradually increasing as well from the perspective of the effectiveness of the capital market the financial information of the listed company is an important source of information for managers and investors to make decisions and earnings management is the important factors which affect the quality of financial information disclosure as the means of manipulating earnings for listed companies it triggered a series of management earnings manipulationthis article mainly from two aspects to conduct the research on the securities analyst earnings forecast accuracy one is the relationship between research and audit institutions and their earnings forecast accuracy and the second one is research based on the impact of corporate governance under the audit institutions and their earnings forecast accuracy relationsfirstly this article summarizes the relevant literature at home and abroad on corporate governance audit institutions audit selection as well as earnings forecast accuracy and the theme of this paper are based on the existing research contents and conclusions the research hypothesis are put forward based on the principalagent theory transaction cost theory asymmetric information theory and they are verified from two aspectsfirstly after the selection of the sample conducted an regression analysis of the data to examine the influence of the audit institutions on securities analyst earnings forecasts secondly based on the impact of corporate governance on audit institution this article added another variable corporate governance as a variable to test the moderating effects of corporate governance on the relationship between audit selection and the prediction accuracy of securities analysts earnings through the study of the relationship between the two external independent agencies and independent third party this paper is dedicated to identify the financial information of the listed companies disclosure level and then to reveal the manipulate degree about the earnings of listed companies at the same time in order to know more about the relationship between the audit agency selection and the predict accuracy of the securities the corporate governance was put forward as a moderating variable and the relationship are verified by the empirical data of listed ashare companies from to 2014through empirical study it was found that in this paperon the one hand in comparison with the noninternational four and nondomestic top six audit institutions the audit institutions as independent third party organization the four international or domestic top six audit institutions have competence advantage objectively like the firm size brand reputation the abundant human resources so on furthermore rather than noninternational four big and before the big six cpa firms the four big or the top six audit institutions have more professional team of auditors and its industry expertise is easier to form scale effectin general conclusion the four international or domestic top six audit institutions can provide more comprehensive audit services and the quality of the information disclosure on their financial report is relatively higher if the listed companies choose four international or domestic top six as their audit institutions the quality of information disclosure is much higher accompanies with the lower manipulation degree of earnings as well as the higher accuracy of securities analyst on the other hand the higher level of corporate governance will motivate the directors and management of the company board to achieve the interests of enterprises and the perfect governance mechanism can also make them more confident about their management level in consideration of reducing agency cost increasing investor confidence as well as improving the companys overall value the listed companies are always preferred to choose auditor team with large scale abundant human client resources high brand reputation as well as professional teams such as the four international or domestic top six major accounting firms and then the quality of financial information disclosure and the transparency of accounting information can be achieved to attract investors and increase the value of the whole enterprise"

    "abstract": "Against the background of the electric vehicles (EVs) development, energy saving and emission reduction, improving the charging efficiency of EVs has become researching focus. An EV charging and swapping energy management system and a bi-directional DC/DC converter control strategy, which can organically combine the EV charging and swapping electric devices with the energy storage devices of the hybrid AC/DC micro-grid, is designed in the paper. The simulation results show that the proposed system is not only effective on load shifting, energy saving, emission reduction and cost saving, but also useful to promote the development of EV technology.",
