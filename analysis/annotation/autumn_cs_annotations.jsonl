Till now, most of the model selection methods emphasize on obtaining the best surrogate model basing on model accuracy assessments. As the population ranking is of the most important part in evolutionary optimization, the target function of surrogate model should focus on the right ranking of candidate solutions. Therefore, in this paper, we make a comparison study on several model quality measures which basically dedicated to measuring the capability of surrogate model in selecting and ranking the candidate solutions. In order to investigate the compatibility between accuracy assessments and ranking correlation methods, four algorithms with different model selection strategies based on different quality measures are designed and comparative study is made by contrasting them to three specific surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms as well as the standard particle swarm optimization. Simulation results on ten commonly used benchmark problems and one engineering case demonstrate the efficacy of the designed model selection strategies and meanwhile provide further insight into the three model quality measures studied in this paper in model selection.","_input_hash":-1788739218,"_task_hash":1139289211,"_view_id":"blocks","accept":["AI/ML","Algorithms"],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1647992063}

{"merged_id":"carticle_0132749925","title":"The Cognitive Reality of Schematic Maps","abstract":"In graphics and language, schematisation is an important method to emphasize certain aspects and to deemphasize others. Different disciplines use schematisation for different reasons. In cartography, graphic schematisation is one aspect of map generalisation. In contrast, cognitive science addresses schematisation as a method to intentionally emphasize certain aspects of knowledge beyond technical necessity; therefore, the notion of schematic map is proposed to denote maps that employ schematisation for cognitive representational reasons. This chapter discusses different views of schematisation from cartography, linguistics, and artificial intelligence. Connections to qualitative reasoning in artificial intelligence are drawn. We address human spatial cognition and present examples of task-oriented representations.

In this study, the distribution of safranal in cheese, whey and r equesn (Spanish whey cheese) and the antifungal potential of whey fractions against the mould Penicillium verrucosum were studied. To this end, a duplicate fabrication of cheeses was performed with raw ewe's milk with the addition of 40 mu g safranal.kg(-1) or control milk (no safranal addition).

In the proposed Viterbi decoder, refresh operations are completely removed in the eDRAM, by ensuring that the read-after-write period of survivor memory is shorter than the retention time of the gain cell. In order to facilitate the write operation with single-supply voltage, a beneficial read word-line (RWL) coupling technique is proposed. In this work, we also present a reference voltage generation scheme to support single-ended read operation. Thanks to the decoupled read and write structure of the gain cell, the proposed eDRAM can support dual-port operations without large area overhead, thus doubling the bandwidth of memories in the Viterbi decoder. To further reduce the area of the customized Viterbi memory, common redundant hardware between the memory peripheral and computational logics is identified and eliminated without latency overhead. The 4 bit soft-decision 64-state Viterbi decoder with 24 kb eDRAM (1-bank) is implemented in 65 nm CMOS process technology.

However, it is computationally demanding since it requires two demodulation filters for each receive channel. To reduce the computational requirements of QD-PRBF, we have previously developed two-stage demodulation (TSD), which reduces the number of lowpass filters by performing demodulation filtering on summation signals.

To improve the performance of TSD-PRBF with reduced number of beamforming points, we propose a new adaptive field-of-view (AFOV) imaging method. In AFOV imaging, the beamforming frequency is adjusted depending on displayed FOV size and the center frequency of received signals. To study its impact on image quality, simulation was conducted using Field II, phantom data were acquired from a commercial ultrasound machine, and the image quality was quantified using spatial (i.e., axial and lateral) and contrast resolution.

Today, in the business world, M&A has become an irresistible trend of the world, increasing scale and increasingly wide range of M&A, and accordingly, the amount of M&A is becoming higher and higher. However, many research results have indicated that the majority of M&A is unsuccessful. Pay excessive premiums is one of the factors that can not be ignored.

{"merged_id": "carticle_0009278952", "title": "Scc2/Nipbl hops between chromosomal cohesin rings after loading.", "abstract": "Abstract\n                The cohesin complex mediates DNA-DNA interactions both between (sister chromatid cohesion) and within chromosomes (DNA looping) via a process thought to involve entrapment of DNAs within its tripartite ring. It has been suggested that intra- chromosome loops are generated through processive extrusion of DNAs through the lumen of cohesin\u2019s ring. Scc2 (Nipbl) is essential for loading cohesin onto chromosomes but not for maintaining sister chromatid cohesion following DNA replication. It has therefore been assumed that Scc2 is involved exclusively in the cohesin loading process. However, it is possible that the stimulation of cohesin\u2019s ABC-like ATPase by Scc2 also has a post-loading function, for example driving loop extrusion. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and single-molecule tracking, we show that Scc2 binds dynamically to chromatin, principally through an association with cohesin. Scc2\u2019s movement within chromatin is consistent with a \u201cstop-and-go\u201d or \u201chopping\u201d motion.

It has been suggested that intra- chromosome loops are generated through processive extrusion of DNAs through the lumen of cohesin\u2019s ring. Scc2 (Nipbl) is essential for loading cohesin onto chromosomes but not for maintaining sister chromatid cohesion following DNA replication. It has therefore been assumed that Scc2 is involved exclusively in the cohesin loading process. However, it is possible that the stimulation of cohesin\u2019s ABC-like ATPase by Scc2 also has a post-loading function, for example driving loop extrusion. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and single-molecule tracking, we show that Scc2 binds dynamically to chromatin, principally through an association with cohesin. Scc2\u2019s movement within chromatin is consistent with a \u201cstop-and-go\u201d or \u201chopping\u201d motion.

This paper will propose a design of a personal firewall for the Digital Media Server (DMS) providing the DLNA services.\nUnlike traditional fire wall, the access control list of this firewall can be easily configured and updated. The key concept of the design is to mimic the contact list used in the instant messaging system. If a Digital Media Controller (DMC) is added to the contact list of the DMS, this DMC can control and manage the media in the DMS.
