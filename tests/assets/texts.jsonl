{"merged_id": "economic_growth", "text": "heterodox economic growth can be defined as the increase or improvement in the inflationadjusted market value of the goods and services produced by an economy over time statisticians conventionally measure such growth as the percent rate of increase in the real gross domestic product or real gdp growth is usually calculated in real terms ie inflationadjusted terms to eliminate the distorting effect of inflation on the prices of goods produced measurement of economic growth uses national income accounting since economic growth is measured as the annual percent change of gross domestic product gdp it has all the advantages and drawbacks of that measure the economic growthrates of countries are commonly compared using the ratio of the gdp to population percapita income the rate of economic growth refers to the geometric annual rate of growth in gdp between the first and the last year over a period of time this growth rate represents the trend in the average level of gdp over the period and ignores any fluctuations in the gdp around this trend economists refer to an increase in economic growth caused by more efficient use of inputs increased productivity of labor of physical capital of energy or of materials as intensive growth in contrast gdp growth caused only by increases in the amount of inputs available for use increased population for example or new territory counts as extensive growth development of new goods and services also generates economic growth as it so happens in the us about of consumer spending in went on goods and services that did not exist in the economic growth rate is calculated from data on gdp estimated by countries statistical agencies the rate of growth of gdp per capita is calculated from data on gdp and people for the initial and final periods included in the analysis of the analyst living standards vary widely from country to country and furthermore the change in living standards over time varies widely from country to country below is a table which shows gdp per person and annualized per person gdp growth for a selection of countries over a period of about years the gdp per person data are adjusted for inflation hence they are real gdp per person more commonly called per capita gdp is the gdp of the entire country divided by the number of people in the country gdp per person is conceptually analogous to average income seemingly small differences in yearly gdp growth lead to large changes in gdp when compounded over time for instance in the above table gdp per person in the united kingdom in the year was at the same time in the united states gdp per person was lower than the uk by about however in the positions were reversed gdp per person was in the united kingdom and in the united states ie gdp per person in the us was more than it was in the uk as the above table shows this means that gdp per person grew on average by per year in the us and by in the uk thus a difference in gdp growth by only a few tenths of a percent per year results in large differences in outcomes when the growth is persistent over a generation this and other observations have led some economists to view gdp growth as the most important part of the field of macroeconomics if we can learn about government policy options that have even small effects on longterm growth rates we can contribute much more to improvements in standards of living than has been provided by the entire history of macroeconomic analysis of countercyclical policy and finetuning economic growth is the part of macroeconomics that really matters it has been observed that gdp growth is influenced by the size of the economy the relation between gdp growth and gdp across the countries at a particular point of time is convex growth increases with gdp reaches its maximum and then begins to decline there exists some extremum value this is not exactly middleincome trap it is observed for both developed and developing economies actually countries having this property belong to conventional growth domain however the extremum could be extended by technological and policy innovations and some countries move into innovative growth domain with higher limiting values in national income accounting per capita output can be calculated using the following factors output per unit of labor input labor productivity hours worked intensity the percentage of the workingage population actually working participation rate and the proportion of the workingage population to the total population demographics the rate of change of gdppopulation is the sum of the rates of change of these four variables plus their cross products economists distinguish between longrun economic growth and shortrun economic changes in production shortrun variation in economic growth is termed the business cycle generally economists attribute the ups and downs in the business cycle to fluctuations in aggregate demand in contrast economic growth is concerned with the longrun trend in production due to structural causes such as technological growth and factor accumulation increases in labor productivity the ratio of the value of output to labor input have historically been the most important source of real per capita economic growth in a famous estimate mit professor robert solow concluded that technological progress has accounted for percent of the longterm rise in us per capita income with increased investment in capital explaining only the remaining percent increases in productivity lower the real cost of goods over the 20th century the real price of many goods fell by over economic growth has traditionally been attributed to the accumulation of human and physical capital and the increase in productivity and creation of new goods arising from technological innovation further division of labour specialization is also fundamental to rising productivity before industrialization technological progress resulted in an increase in the population which was kept in check by food supply and other resources which acted to limit per capita income a condition known as the malthusian trap the rapid economic growth that occurred during the industrial revolution was remarkable because it was in excess of population growth providing an escape from the malthusian trap countries that industrialized eventually saw their population growth slow down a phenomenon known as the demographic transition increases in productivity are the major factor responsible for per capita economic growththis has been especially evident since the mid19th century most of the economic growth in the 20th century was due to increased output per unit of labor materials energy and land less input per widget the balance of the growth in output has come from using more inputs both of these changes increase output the increased output included more of the same goods produced previously and new goods and services during the industrial revolution mechanization began to replace hand methods in manufacturing and new processes streamlined production of chemicals iron steel and other products machine tools made the economical production of metal parts possible so that parts could be interchangeable see interchangeable parts during the second industrial revolution a major factor of productivity growth was the substitution of inanimate power for human and animal labor also there was a great increase in power as steampowered electricity generation and internal combustion supplanted limited wind and water power since that replacement the great expansion of total power was driven by continuous improvements in energy conversion efficiency other major historical sources of productivity were automation transportation infrastructures canals railroads and highways new materials steel and power which includes steam and internal combustion engines and electricity other productivity improvements included mechanized agriculture and scientific agriculture including chemical fertilizers and livestock and poultry management and the green revolution interchangeable parts made with machine tools powered by electric motors evolved into mass production which is universally used today great sources of productivity improvement in the late 19th century were railroads steam ships horsepulled reapers and combine harvesters and steampowered factories the invention of processes for making cheap steel were important for many forms of mechanization and transportation by the late 19th century both prices and weekly work hours fell because less labor materials and energy were required to produce and transport goods however real wages rose allowing workers to improve their diet buy consumer goods and afford better housing mass production of the 1920s created overproduction which was arguably one of several causes of the great depression of the 1930s following the great depression economic growth resumed aided in part by increased demand for existing goods and services such as automobiles telephones radios electricity and household appliances new goods and services included television air conditioning and commercial aviation after creating enough new demand to stabilize the work week the building of highway infrastructures also contributed to post world war ii growth as did capital investments in manufacturing and chemical industries the post world war ii economy also benefited from the discovery of vast amounts of oil around the world particularly in the middle east by john w kendricks estimate threequarters of increase in us per capita gdp from to was due to increased productivity economic growth in the united states slowed down after in contrast growth in asia has been strong since then starting with japan and spreading to four asian tigers china southeast asia the indian subcontinent and asia pacific in south korea had a lower per capita gdp than ghana and by it was times as high as ghanas the japanese economic growth has slackened considerably since the late 1980s productivity in the united states grew at an increasing rate throughout the 19th century and was most rapid in the early to middle decades of the 20th century us productivity growth spiked towards the end of the century in due to an acceleration in the rate of technological innovation known as moores law after us productivity growth returned to the low levels of capital in economics ordinarily refers to physical capital which consists of structures largest component of physical capital and equipment used in business machinery factory equipment computers and office equipment construction equipment business vehicles medical equipment etc up to a point increases in the amount of capital per worker are an important cause of economic output growth capital is subject to diminishing returns because of the amount that can be effectively invested and because of the growing burden of depreciation in the development of economic theory the distribution of income was considered to be between labor and the owners of land and capital in recent decades there have been several asian countries with high rates of economic growth driven by capital investment the work week declined considerably over the 19th century by the 1920s the average work week in the us was hours but the work week was reduced to hours after which overtime premium was applied as part of the national industrial recovery act of demographic factors may influence growth by changing the employment to population ratio and the labor force participation rate industrialization creates a demographic transition in which birth rates decline and the average age of the population increases women with fewer children and better access to market employment tend to join the labor force in higher percentages there is a reduced demand for child labor and children spend more years in school the increase in the percentage of women in the labor force in the us contributed to economic growth as did the entrance of the baby boomers into the workforce see spending wave many theoretical and empirical analyses of economic growth attribute a major role to a countrys level of human capital defined as the skills of the population or the work force human capital has been included in both neoclassical and endogenous growth models a countrys level of human capital is difficult to measure since it is created at home at school and on the job economists have attempted to measure human capital using numerous proxies including the populations level of literacy its level of numeracy its level of book productioncapita its average level of formal schooling its average test score on international tests and its cumulative depreciated investment in formal schooling the most commonlyused measure of human capital is the level average years of school attainment in a country building upon the data development of robert barro and jongwha lee this measure is widely used because barro and lee provide data for numerous countries in fiveyear intervals for a long period of time one problem with the schooling attainment measure is that the amount of human capital acquired in a year of schooling is not the same at all levels of schooling and is not the same in all countries this measure also presumes that human capital is only developed in formal schooling contrary to the extensive evidence that families neighborhoods peers and health also contribute to the development of human capital despite these potential limitations theodore breton has shown that this measure can represent human capital in loglinear growth models because across countries gdpadult has a loglinear relationship to average years of schooling which is consistent with the loglinear relationship between workers personal incomes and years of schooling in the mincer model eric hanushek and dennis kimko introduced measures of students mathematics and science skills from international assessments into growth analysis they found that this measure of human capital was very significantly related to economic growth eric hanushek and ludger womann have extended this analysis theodore breton shows that the correlation between economic growth and students average test scores in hanushek and womanns analyses is actually due to the relationship in countries with less than eight years of schooling he shows that economic growth is not correlated with average scores in more educated countries hanushek and womann further investigate whether the relationship of knowledge capital to economic growth is causal they show that the level of students cognitive skills can explain the slow growth in latin america and the rapid growth in east asia joerg baten and jan luiten van zanden employ book production per capita as a proxy for sophisticated literacy capabilities and find that countries with high levels of human capital formation in the 18th century initiated or participated in the industrialization process of the 19th century whereas countries with low levels of human capital formation were unable to do so among them many of todays less developed countries such as india indonesia and china as institutions influence behavior and incentives in real life they forge the success or failure of nations in economics and economic history the transition to capitalism from earlier economic systems was enabled by the adoption of government policies that facilitated commerce and gave individuals more personal and economic freedom these included new laws favorable to the establishment of business including contract law and laws providing for the protection of private property and the abolishment of antiusury laws much of this literature was built on the success story of the british state after the glorious revolution of in which high fiscal capacity combined with constraints on the power of the king generated some respect for the rule of law however others have questioned that this institutional formula is not so easily replicable elsewhere as a change in the constitutionand the type of institutions created by that changedoes not necessarily create a change in political power if the economic powers of that society are not aligned with the new set of rule of law institutions in england a dramatic increase in the states fiscal capacity followed the creation of constraints on the crown but elsewhere in europe increases in state capacity happened before major rule of law reforms there are many different ways through which states achieved state fiscal capacity and this different capacity accelerated or hindered their economic development thanks to the underlying homogeneity of its land and people england was able to achieve a unified legal and fiscal system since the middle ages that enabled it to substantially increase the taxes it raised after on the other hand the french experience of state building faced much stronger resistance from local feudal powers keeping it legally and fiscally fragmented until the french revolution despite significant increases in state capacity during the seventeenth century furthermore prussia and the habsburg empiremuch more heterogeneous states than englandwere able to increase state capacity during the eighteenth century without constraining the powers of the executive nevertheless it is unlikely that a country will generate institutions that respect property rights and the rule of law without having had first intermediate fiscal and political institutions that create incentives for elites to support them many of these intermediate level institutions relied on informal privateorder arrangements that combined with publicorder institutions associated with states to lay the foundations of modern rule of law states in many poor and developing countries much land and housing are held outside the formal or legal property ownership registration system in many urban areas the poor invade private or government land to build their houses so they do not hold title to these properties much unregistered property is held in informal form through various property associations and other arrangements reasons for extralegal ownership include excessive bureaucratic red tape in buying property and building in some countries it can take over steps and up to years to build on government land other causes of extralegal property are failures to notarize transaction documents or having documents notarized but failing to have them recorded with the official agency not having clear legal title to property limits its potential to be used as collateral to secure loans depriving many poor countries of one of their most important potential sources of capital unregistered businesses and lack of accepted accounting methods are other factors that limit potential capital businesses and individuals participating in unreported business activity and owners of unregistered property face costs such as bribes and payoffs that offset much of any taxes avoided democracy does cause growth according to acemoglu et al specifically democracy increases future gdp by encouraging investment increasing schooling inducing economic reforms improving public goods provision and reducing social unrest unesco and the united nations also consider that cultural property protection highquality education cultural diversity and social cohesion in armed conflicts are particularly necessary for qualitative growth according to daron acemoglu simon johnson and james robinson the positive correlation between high income and cold climate is a byproduct of history europeans adopted very different colonization policies in different colonies with different associated institutions in places where these colonizers faced high mortality rates eg due to the presence of tropical diseases they could not settle permanently and they were thus more likely to establish extractive institutions which persisted after independence in places where they could settle permanently eg those with temperate climates they established institutions with this objective in mind and modeled them after those in their european homelands in these neoeuropes better institutions in turn produced better development outcomes thus although other economists focus on the identity or type of legal system of the colonizers to explain institutions these authors look at the environmental conditions in the colonies to explain institutions for instance former colonies have inherited corrupt governments and geopolitical boundaries set by the colonizers that are not properly placed regarding the geographical locations of different ethnic groups creating internal disputes and conflicts that hinder development in another example societies that emerged in colonies without solid native populations established better property rights and incentives for longterm investment than those where native populations were large in why nations fail acemoglu and robinson said that the english in north america started by trying to repeat the success of the spanish conquistadors in extracting wealth especially gold and silver from the countries they had conquered this system repeatedly failed for the english their successes rested on giving land and a voice in the government to every male settler to incentivize productive labor in virginia it took twelve years and many deaths from starvation before the governor decided to try democracy policymakers and scholars frequently emphasize the importance of entrepreneurship for economic growth however surprisingly few research empirically examine and quantify entrepreneurships impact on growth this is due to endogeneityforces that drive economic growth also drive entrepreneurship in other words the empirical analysis of the impact of entrepreneurship on growth is difficult because of the joint determination of entrepreneurship and economic growth a few papers use quasiexperimental designs and have found that entrepreneurship and the density of small businesses indeed have a causal impact on regional growth another major cause of economic growth is the introduction of new products and services and the improvement of existing products new products create demand which is necessary to offset the decline in employment that occurs through laborsaving technology and to a lesser extent employment declines due to savings in energy and materials in the us by about of consumer spending was for goods and services that did not exist in also the creation of new services has been more important than invention of new goods economic growth in the us and other developed countries went through phases that affected growth through changes in the labor force participation rate and the relative sizes of economic sectors the transition from an agricultural economy to manufacturing increased the size of the sector with high output per hour the highproductivity manufacturing sector while reducing the size of the sector with lower output per hour the lower productivity agricultural sector eventually high productivity growth in manufacturing reduced the sector size as prices fell and employment shrank relative to other sectors the service and government sectors where output per hour and productivity growth is low saw increases in their shares of the economy and employment during the 1990s the public sector has since contracted while the service economy expanded in the 2000s the structural change could also be viewed from another angle it is possible to divide real economic growth into two components an indicator of extensive economic growththe quantitative gdpand an indicator of the improvement of the quality of goods and servicesthe qualitative gdp adam smith pioneered modern economic growth and performance theory in his book the wealth of nations first published in the book examined the contributions to production of labor land and capital it demonstrated the economic importance of large buoyant markets and industrial specialization it also documented the influence of noneconomic factors such as the politicallegal environment on national prosperity smiths study combined basic economic theory with personal observation and historical documentary references the malthusian theory proposes that over most of human history technological progress caused larger population growth but had no impact on income per capita in the long run according to the theory while technologically advanced economies over this epoch were characterized by higher population density their level of income per capita was not different from those among technologically regressed society the conceptual foundations of the malthusian theory were formed by thomas malthus and a modern representation of these approach is provided by ashraf and galor in line with the predictions of the malthusian theory a crosscountry analysis finds a significant positive effect of the technological level on population density and an insignificant effect on income per capita significantly over the years in classical ricardian economics the theory of production and the theory of growth are based on the theory or law of variable proportions whereby increasing either of the factors of production labor or capital while holding the other constant and assuming no technological change will increase output but at a diminishing rate that eventually will approach zero these concepts have their origins in thomas malthuss theorizing about agriculture malthuss examples included the number of seeds harvested relative to the number of seeds planted capital on a plot of land and the size of the harvest from a plot of land versus the number of workers employed see also diminishing returns criticisms of classical growth theory are that technology an important factor in economic growth is held constant and that economies of scale are ignored one popular theory in the 1940s was the big push model which suggested that countries needed to jump from one stage of development to another through a virtuous cycle in which large investments in infrastructure and education coupled with private investments would move the economy to a more productive stage breaking free from economic paradigms appropriate to a lower productivity stage the idea was revived and formulated rigorously in the late 1980s by kevin murphy andrei shleifer and robert vishny robert solow and trevor swan developed what eventually became the main model used in growth economics in the 1950s this model assumes that there are diminishing returns to capital and labor capital accumulates through investment but its level or stock continually decreases due to depreciation due to the diminishing returns to capital with increases in capitalworker and absent technological progress economic outputworker eventually reaches a point where capital per worker and economic outputworker remain constant because annual investment in capital equals annual depreciation this condition is called the steady state in the solowswan model if productivity increases through technological progress then outputworker increases even when the economy is in the steady state if productivity increases at a constant rate outputworker also increases at a related steadystate rate as a consequence growth in the model can occur either by increasing the share of gdp invested or through technological progress but at whatever share of gdp invested capitalworker eventually converges on the steady state leaving the growth rate of outputworker determined only by the rate of technological progress as a consequence with world technology available to all and progressing at a constant rate all countries have the same steady state rate of growth each country has a different level of gdpworker determined by the share of gdp it invests but all countries have the same rate of economic growth implicitly in this model rich countries are those that have invested a high share of gdp for a long time poor countries can become rich by increasing the share of gdp they invest one important prediction of the model mostly borne out by the data is that of conditional convergence the idea that poor countries will grow faster and catch up with rich countries as long as they have similar investment and saving rates and access to the same technology the solowswan model is considered an exogenous growth model because it does not explain why countries invest different shares of gdp in capital nor why technology improves over time instead the rate of investment and the rate of technological progress are exogenous the value of the model is that it predicts the pattern of economic growth once these two rates are specified its failure to explain the determinants of these rates is one of its limitations although the rate of investment in the model is exogenous under certain conditions the model implicitly predicts convergence in the rates of investment across countries in a global economy with a global financial capital market financial capital flows to the countries with the highest return on investment in the solowswan model countries with less capitalworker poor countries have a higher return on investment due to the diminishing returns to capital as a consequence capitalworker and outputworker in a global financial capital market should converge to the same level in all countries since historically financial capital has not flowed to the countries with less capitalworker the basic solowswan model has a conceptual flaw beginning in the 1990s this flaw has been addressed by adding additional variables to the model that can explain why some countries are less productive than others and therefore do not attract flows of global financial capital even though they have less physical capitalworker in practice convergence was rarely achieved in solow applied his model to data from the us gross national product to estimate contributions this showed that the increase in capital and labor stock only accounted for about half of the output while the population increase adjustments to capital explained eighth this remaining unaccounted growth output is known as the solow residual here the a of t technical progress was the reason for increased output nevertheless the model still had flaws it gave no room for policy to influence the growth rate few attempts were also made by the rand corporation the nonprofit think tank and frequently visiting economist kenneth arrow to work out the kinks in the model they suggested that new knowledge was indivisible and that it is endogenous with a certain fixed cost arrows further explained that new knowledge obtained by firms comes from practice and built a model that knowledge accumulated through experience according to harrod the natural growth rate is the maximum rate of growth allowed by the increase of variables like population growth technological improvement and growth in natural resources in fact the natural growth rate is the highest attainable growth rate which would bring about the fullest possible employment of the resources existing in the economy unsatisfied with the assumption of exogenous technological progress in the solowswan model economists worked to endogenize ie explain it from within the models productivity growth in the 1980s the resulting endogenous growth theory most notably advanced by robert lucas jr and his student paul romer includes a mathematical explanation of technological advancement this model also incorporated a new concept of human capital the skills and knowledge that make workers productive unlike physical capital human capital has increasing rates of return research done in this area has focused on what increases human capital eg education or technological change eg innovation on memorial day weekend in a conference in buffalo brought together the great minds in economics the idea was to evaluate the conflicting theories of growth romer krugman barro becker were in attendance along with many other rising stars and high profiled economists of the time amongst many papers that day the one that stood out was romers micro foundations for aggregate technological change the micro foundation claimed that endogenous technological change had the concept of intellectual property imbedded and that knowledge is an input and output of production romer argued that outcomes to the national growth rates were significantly affected by public policy trade activity and intellectual property he stressed that cumulative capital and specialization were key and that not only population growth can increase capital of knowledge it was human capital that is specifically trained in harvesting new ideas while intellectual property may be important baker cites multiple sources claiming that stronger patent protection seems to be associated with slower growth thats particularly true for patents in the ethical health care industry in effect taxpayers pay twice for new drugs and diagnostic procedures first in tax subsidies and second for the high prices of diagnostic procedures treatments if the results of research paid by taxpayers were placed in the public domain baker claims that people everywhere would be healthier because better diagnoses and treatment would be more affordable the world over one branch of endogenous growth theory was developed on the foundations of the schumpeterian theory named after the 20thcentury austrian economist joseph schumpeter the approach explains growth as a consequence of innovation and a process of creative destruction that captures the dual nature of technological progress in terms of creation entrepreneurs introduce new products or processes in the hope that they will enjoy temporary monopolylike profits as they capture markets in doing so they make old technologies or products obsolete this can be seen as an annulment of previous technologies which makes them obsolete and destroys the rents generated by previous innovations a major model that illustrates schumpeterian growth is the aghionhowitt model ru unified growth theory was developed by oded galor and his coauthors to address the inability of endogenous growth theory to explain key empirical regularities in the growth processes of individual economies and the world economy as a whole unlike endogenous growth theory that focuses entirely on the modern growth regime and is therefore unable to explain the roots of inequality across nations unified growth theory captures in a single framework the fundamental phases of the process of development in the course of human history i the malthusian epoch that was prevalent over most of human history ii the escape from the malthusian trap iii the emergence of human capital as a central element in the growth process iv the onset of the fertility decline v the origins of the modern era of sustained economic growth and vi the roots of divergence in income per capita across nations in the past two centuries the theory suggests that during most of human existence technological progress was offset by population growth and living standards were near subsistence across time and space however the reinforcing interaction between the rate of technological progress and the size and composition of the population has gradually increased the pace of technological progress enhancing the importance of education in the ability of individuals to adapt to the changing technological environment the rise in the allocation of resources towards education triggered a fertility decline enabling economies to allocate a larger share of the fruits of technological progress to a steady increase in income per capita rather than towards the growth of population paving the way for the emergence of sustained economic growth the theory further suggests that variations in biogeographical characteristics as well as cultural and institutional characteristics have generated a differential pace of transition from stagnation to growth across countries and consequently divergence in their income per capita over the past two centuries the prevailing views about the role of inequality in the growth process has radically shifted in the past century the classical perspective as expressed by adam smith and others suggests that inequality fosters the growth process specifically since the aggregate saving increases with inequality due to higher property to save among the wealthy the classical viewpoint suggests that inequality stimulates capital accumulation and therefore economic growth the neoclassical perspective that is based on representative agent approach denies the role of inequality in the growth process it suggests that while the growth process may affect inequality income distribution has no impact on the growth process the modern perspective which has emerged in the late 1980s suggests in contrast that income distribution has a significant impact on the growth process the modern perspective originated by galor and zeira highlights the important role of heterogeneity in the determination of aggregate economic activity and economic growth in particular galor and zeira argue that since credit markets are imperfect inequality has an enduring impact on human capital formation the level of income per capita and the growth process in contrast to the classical paradigm which underlined the positive implications of inequality for capital formation and economic growth galor and zeira argue that inequality has an adverse effect on human capital formation and the development process in all but the very poor economies later theoretical developments have reinforced the view that inequality has an adverse effect on the growth process specifically alesina and rodrik and persson and tabellini advance a political economy mechanism and argue that inequality has a negative impact on economic development since it creates a pressure for distortionary redistributive policies that have an adverse effect on investment and economic growth in accordance with the credit market imperfection approach a study by roberto perotti showed that inequality is associated with lower level of human capital formation education experience apprenticeship and higher level of fertility while lower level of human capital is associated with lower growth and lower levels of economic growth in contrast his examination of the political economy channel found no support for the political economy mechanism consequently the political economy perspective on the relationship between inequality and growth have been revised and later studies have established that inequality may provide an incentive for the elite to block redistributive policies and institutional changes in particular inequality in the distribution of land ownership provides the landed elite with an incentive to limit the mobility of rural workers by depriving them from education and by blocking the development of the industrial sector a unified theory of inequality and growth that captures that changing role of inequality in the growth process offers a reconciliation between the conflicting predictions of classical viewpoint that maintained that inequality is beneficial for growth and the modern viewpoint that suggests that in the presence of credit market imperfections inequality predominantly results in underinvestment in human capital and lower economic growth this unified theory of inequality and growth developed by oded galor and omer moav suggests that the effect of inequality on the growth process has been reversed as human capital has replaced physical capital as the main engine of economic growth in the initial phases of industrialization when physical capital accumulation was the dominating source of economic growth inequality boosted the development process by directing resources toward individuals with higher propensity to save however in later phases as human capital become the main engine of economic growth more equal distribution of income in the presence of credit constraints stimulated investment in human capital and economic growth in french economist thomas piketty postulated that in periods when the average annual rate on return on investment in capital r exceeds the average annual growth in economic output g the rate of inequality will increase according to piketty this is the case because wealth that is already held or inherited which is expected to grow at the rate r will grow at a rate faster than wealth accumulated through labor which is more closely tied to g an advocate of reducing inequality levels piketty suggests levying a global wealth tax in order to reduce the divergence in wealth caused by inequality the reduced form empirical relationship between inequality and growth was studied by alberto alesina and dani rodrik and torsten persson and guido tabellini they find that inequality is negatively associated with economic growth in a crosscountry analysis robert barro reexamined the reduced form relationship between inequality on economic growth in a panel of countries he argues that there is little overall relation between income inequality and rates of growth and investment however his empirical strategy limits its applicability to the understanding of the relationship between inequality and growth for several reasons first his regression analysis control for education fertility investment and it therefore excludes by construction the important effect of inequality on growth via education fertility and investment his findings simply imply that inequality has no direct effect on growth beyond the important indirect effects through the main channels proposed in the literature second his study analyzes the effect of inequality on the average growth rate in the following years however existing theories suggest that the effect of inequality will be observed much later as is the case in human capital formation for instance third the empirical analysis does not account for biases that are generated by reverse causality and omitted variables recent papers based on superior data find negative relationship between inequality and growth andrew berg and jonathan ostry of the international monetary fund find that lower net inequality is robustly correlated with faster and more durable growth controlling for the level of redistribution likewise dierk herzer and sebastian vollmer find that increased income inequality reduces economic growth the galor and zeiras model predicts that the effect of rising inequality on gdp per capita is negative in relatively rich countries but positive in poor countries these testable predictions have been examined and confirmed empirically in recent studies in particular bruckner and lederman test the prediction of the model by in the panel of countries during the period by considering the impact of the interaction between the level of income inequality and the initial level of gdp per capita in line with the predictions of the model they find that at the 25th percentile of initial income in the world sample a percentage point increase in the gini coefficient increases income per capita by whereas at the 75th percentile of initial income a percentage point increase in the gini coefficient decreases income per capita by moreover the proposed human capital mechanism that mediates the effect of inequality on growth in the galorzeira model is also confirmed increases in income inequality increase human capital in poor countries but reduce it in high and middleincome countries this recent support for the predictions of the galorzeira model is in line with earlier findings roberto perotti showed that in accordance with the credit market imperfection approach developed by galor and zeira inequality is associated with lower level of human capital formation education experience apprenticeship and higher level of fertility while lower level of human capital is associated with lower levels of economic growth princeton economist roland benabous finds that the growth process of korea and the philippines are broadly consistent with the creditconstrained humancapital accumulation hypothesis in addition andrew berg and jonathan ostry suggest that inequality seems to affect growth through human capital accumulation and fertility channels in contrast perotti argues that the political economy mechanism is not supported empirically inequality is associated with lower redistribution and lower redistribution underinvestment in education and infrastructure is associated with lower economic growth over long periods of time even small rates of growth such as a annual increase have large effects for example the united kingdom experienced a average annual increase in its inflationadjusted gdp between and in the gdp was million pounds it grew to million pounds by a growth rate that averaged over years resulted in a 32fold increase in gdp by the large impact of a relatively small growth rate over a long period of time is due to the power of exponential growth the rule of a mathematical result states that if something grows at the rate of x per year then its level will double every 72x years for example a growth rate of per annum leads to a doubling of the gdp within years whilst a growth rate of per year leads to a doubling of gdp within nine years thus a small difference in economic growth rates between countries can result in very different standards of living for their populations if this small difference continues for many years one theory that relates economic growth with quality of life is the threshold hypothesis which states that economic growth up to a point brings with it an increase in quality of life but at that point called the threshold point further economic growth can bring with it a deterioration in quality of life this results in an upsidedownushaped curve where the vertex of the curve represents the level of growth that should be targeted happiness has been shown to increase with gdp per capita at least up to a level of per person economic growth has the indirect potential to alleviate poverty as a result of a simultaneous increase in employment opportunities and increased labor productivity a study by researchers at the overseas development institute odi of countries that experienced growth found that in cases poverty was alleviated in some instances quality of life factors such as healthcare outcomes and educational attainment as well as social and political liberties do not improve as economic growth occursdubious discuss productivity increases do not always lead to increased wages as can be seen in the united states where the gap between productivity and wages has been rising since the 1980s while acknowledging the central role economic growth can potentially play in human development poverty reduction and the achievement of the millennium development goals it is becoming widely understood amongst the development community that special efforts must be made to ensure poorer sections of society are able to participate in economic growth the effect of economic growth on poverty reduction the growth elasticity of poverty can depend on the existing level of inequality for instance with low inequality a country with a growth rate of per head and of its population living in poverty can halve poverty in ten years but a country with high inequality would take nearly years to achieve the same reduction in the words of the secretary general of the united nations ban kimoon while economic growth is necessary it is not sufficient for progress on reducing poverty critics such as the club of rome argue that a narrow view of economic growth combined with globalization is creating a scenario where we could see a systemic collapse of our planets natural resources concerns about negative environmental effects of growth have prompted some people to advocate lower levels of growth or the abandoning of growth altogether in academia concepts like uneconomic growth steadystate economy and degrowth have been developed in order to achieve this and to overcome possible growth imperatives in politics green parties embrace the global greens charter recognising that the dogma of economic growth at any cost and the excessive and wasteful use of natural resources without considering earths carrying capacity are causing extreme deterioration in the environment and a massive extinction of species the global assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services published by the united nations intergovernmental sciencepolicy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services warned that given the substantial loss of biodiversity society should not focus solely on economic growth anthropologist eduardo s brondizio one of the cochairs of the report said we need to change our narratives both our individual narratives that associate wasteful consumption with quality of life and with status and the narratives of the economic systems that still consider that environmental degradation and social inequality are inevitable outcomes of economic growth economic growth is a means and not an end we need to look for the quality of life of the planet those more optimistic about the environmental impacts of growth believe that though localized environmental effects may occur largescale ecological effects are minor the argument as stated by commentator julian lincoln simon states that if these globalscale ecological effects exist human ingenuity will find ways to adapt to them conversely partha dasgupta in a report on the economics of biodiversity commissioned by the british treasury argues that biodiversity is collapsing faster than at any time in human history as a result of the demands of contemporary human civilization which far exceed natures capacity to supply us with the goods and services we all rely on we would require earths to maintain the worlds current living standards he says that major transformative changes will be needed akin to or even greater than those of the marshall plan including abandoning gdp as a measure of economic success and societal progress in a warning on climate change signed by scientists from over nations said economic growth is the driving force behind the excessive extraction of materials and overexploitation of ecosystems and that this must be quickly curtailed to maintain longterm sustainability of the biosphere they add that our goals need to shift from gdp growth and the pursuit of affluence toward sustaining ecosystems and improving human wellbeing by prioritizing basic needs and reducing inequality a paper authored by top scientists in frontiers in conservation science posited that given the environmental crises including biodiversity loss and climate change and possible ghastly future facing humanity there must be fundamental changes to global capitalism including the abolition of perpetual economic growth up to the present there is a close correlation between economic growth and the rate of carbon dioxide emissions across nations although there is also a considerable divergence in carbon intensity carbon emissions per gdp up to the present there is also a direct relation between global economic wealth and the rate of global emissions the stern review notes that the prediction that under business as usual global emissions will be sufficient to propel greenhouse gas concentrations to over ppm co2 by and over ppm by the end of this century is robust to a wide range of changes in model assumptions the scientific consensus is that planetary ecosystem functioning without incurring dangerous risks requires stabilization at ppm as a consequence growthoriented environmental economists propose government intervention into switching sources of energy production favouring wind solar hydroelectric and nuclear this would largely confine use of fossil fuels to either domestic cooking needs such as for kerosene burners or where carbon capture and storage technology can be costeffective and reliable the stern review published by the united kingdom government in concluded that an investment of of gdp later changed to would be sufficient to avoid the worst effects of climate change and that failure to do so could risk climaterelated costs equal to of gdp because carbon capture and storage are as yet widely unproven and its long term effectiveness such as in containing carbon dioxide leaks unknown and because of current costs of alternative fuels these policy responses largely rest on faith of technological change british conservative politician and journalist nigel lawson has deemed carbon emission trading an inefficient system of rationing instead he favours carbon taxes to make full use of the efficiency of the market however in order to avoid the migration of energyintensive industries the whole world should impose such a tax not just britain lawson pointed out there is no point in taking the lead if nobody follows suit many earlier predictions of resource depletion such as thomas malthus predictions about approaching famines in europe the population bomb and the simonehrlich wager have not materialized diminished production of most resources has not occurred so far one reason being that advancements in technology and science have allowed some previously unavailable resources to be produced in some cases substitution of more abundant materials such as plastics for cast metals lowered growth of usage for some metals in the case of the limited resource of land famine was relieved firstly by the revolution in transportation caused by railroads and steam ships and later by the green revolution and chemical fertilizers especially the haber process for ammonia synthesis resource quality is composed of a variety of factors including ore grades location altitude above or below sea level proximity to railroads highways water supply and climate these factors affect the capital and operating cost of extracting resources in the case of minerals lower grades of mineral resources are being extracted requiring higher inputs of capital and energy for both extraction and processing copper ore grades have declined significantly over the last century another example is natural gas from shale and other low permeability rock whose extraction requires much higher inputs of energy capital and materials than conventional gas in previous decades offshore oil and gas have exponentially increased cost as water depth increases some physical scientists like sanyam mittal regard continuous economic growth as unsustainable several factors may constrain economic growth for example finite peaked or depleted resources in the limits to growth study modeled limitations to infinite growth originally ridiculed some of the predicted trends have materialized raising concerns of an impending collapse or decline due to resource constraints malthusians such as william r catton jr are skeptical of technological advances that improve resource availability such advances and increases in efficiency they suggest merely accelerate the drawing down of finite resources catton claims that increasing rates of resource extraction are stealing ravenously from the future energy economic theories hold that rates of energy consumption and energy efficiency are linked causally to economic growth the garrett relation holds that there has been a fixed relationship between current rates of global energy consumption and the historical accumulation of world gdp independent of the year considered it follows that economic growth as represented by gdp growth requires higher rates of energy consumption growth seemingly paradoxically these are sustained through increases in energy efficiency increases in energy efficiency were a portion of the increase in total factor productivity some of the most technologically important innovations in history involved increases in energy efficiency these include the great improvements in efficiency of conversion of heat to work the reuse of heat the reduction in friction and the transmission of power especially through electrification there is a strong correlation between per capita electricity consumption and economic development ecological economics criticizes the possibility of infinite economic growth current economic models suggest the economy can grow continuously as a perpetual motion machine however according to the laws of thermodynamics perpetual motion machines do not exist the first laws says matter and energy cannot be created or destroyed and the second laws says that matter and energy move from a low entropy useful state towards a less useful higher entropy state thus no system can continue without inputs of new energy that exit as high entropy waste just as no animal can live on its own waste no economy can recycle the waste it produces without the input of new energy to reproduce itself matter and energy enter the economy in the form of low entropy natural capital such as solar energy oil wells fisheries and mines these materials and energy are used by households and firms a like to create products and wealth after the material are used up the energy and matter leaves the economy in the form of high entropy waste that is no longer valuable to the economy the natural materials that power the motion of the economic system from the environment and the waste must be absorbed by the larger ecosystem in which the economy exists it cannot be ignored that the economy intrinsically requires natural resources and the creation of waste that must be absorbed in some manner the economy can only continue churning if it has matter and energy to power it and the ability to absorb the waste it creates this matter and low entropy energy and the ability to absorb waste exists in a finite amount and thus there is a finite amount of inputs to the flow and outputs of the flow that the environment can handle implying there is a sustainable limit to motion and therefore growth of the economy lets consider armenia as an example to examine economic fluctuations and growth armenia got its independence from ussr in the year the gdp per capita of the country was only as armenia was at war with neighbouring azerbaijan until the economic situation in the country was not improving in gdp per capita was the situation got much better afterwards a big rapid economic growth occurred in the country in the 2000s due to a boom in construction gdp per capita reached in due to the great recession the value of gdp per capita declined in the year but continued rising afterwards the final decline in gdp per capita was seen in which was resulted from the covid19 pandemic and the second artsakh war currently the gdp per capita of the country is"}

{"merged_id": "speech_recognition", "text": "speech recognition is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies that enable the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers with the main benefit of searchability it is also known as automatic speech recognition asr computer speech recognition or speech to text stt it incorporates knowledge and research in the computer science linguistics and computer engineering fields the reverse process is speech synthesis some speech recognition systems require training also called enrollment where an individual speaker reads text or isolated vocabulary into the system the system analyzes the persons specific voice and uses it to finetune the recognition of that persons speech resulting in increased accuracy systems that do not use training are called speakerindependent systems systems that use training are called speaker dependent speech recognition applications include voice user interfaces such as voice dialing eg call home call routing eg i would like to make a collect call domotic appliance control search key words eg find a podcast where particular words were spoken simple data entry eg entering a credit card number preparation of structured documents eg a radiology report determining speaker characteristics speechtotext processing eg word processors or emails and aircraft usually termed direct voice input the term voice recognition or speaker identification refers to identifying the speaker rather than what they are saying recognizing the speaker can simplify the task of translating speech in systems that have been trained on a specific persons voice or it can be used to authenticate or verify the identity of a speaker as part of a security process from the technology perspective speech recognition has a long history with several waves of major innovations most recently the field has benefited from advances in deep learning and big data the advances are evidenced not only by the surge of academic papers published in the field but more importantly by the worldwide industry adoption of a variety of deep learning methods in designing and deploying speech recognition systems the key areas of growth were vocabulary size speaker independence and processing speed raj reddy was the first person to take on continuous speech recognition as a graduate student at stanford university in the late 1960s previous systems required users to pause after each word reddys system issued spoken commands for playing chess around this time soviet researchers invented the dynamic time warping dtw algorithm and used it to create a recognizer capable of operating on a 200word vocabulary dtw processed speech by dividing it into short frames eg 10ms segments and processing each frame as a single unit although dtw would be superseded by later algorithms the technique carried on achieving speaker independence remained unsolved at this time period during the late 1960s leonard baum developed the mathematics of markov chains at the institute for defense analysis a decade later at cmu raj reddys students james baker and janet m baker began using the hidden markov model hmm for speech recognition james baker had learned about hmms from a summer job at the institute of defense analysis during his undergraduate education the use of hmms allowed researchers to combine different sources of knowledge such as acoustics language and syntax in a unified probabilistic model the 1980s also saw the introduction of the ngram language model much of the progress in the field is owed to the rapidly increasing capabilities of computers at the end of the darpa program in the best computer available to researchers was the pdp10 with mb ram it could take up to minutes to decode just seconds of speech two practical products were by this point the vocabulary of the typical commercial speech recognition system was larger than the average human vocabulary raj reddys former student xuedong huang developed the sphinxii system at cmu the sphinxii system was the first to do speakerindependent large vocabulary continuous speech recognition and it had the best performance in darpas evaluation handling continuous speech with a large vocabulary was a major milestone in the history of speech recognition huang went on to found the speech recognition group at microsoft in raj reddys student kaifu lee joined apple where in he helped develop a speech interface prototype for the apple computer known as casper lernout hauspie a belgiumbased speech recognition company acquired several other companies including kurzweil applied intelligence in and dragon systems in the lh speech technology was used in the windows xp operating system lh was an industry leader until an accounting scandal brought an end to the company in the speech technology from lh was bought by scansoft which became nuance in apple originally licensed software from nuance to provide speech recognition capability to its digital assistant siri in the 2000s darpa sponsored two speech recognition programs effective affordable reusable speechtotext ears in and global autonomous language exploitation gale four teams participated in the ears program ibm a team led by bbn with limsi and univ of pittsburgh cambridge university and a team composed of icsi sri and university of washington ears funded the collection of the switchboard telephone speech corpus containing hours of recorded conversations from over speakers the gale program focused on arabic and mandarin broadcast news speech googles first effort at speech recognition came in after hiring some researchers from nuance the first product was goog411 a telephone based directory service the recordings from goog411 produced valuable data that helped google improve their recognition systems google voice search is now supported in over languages in the united states the national security agency has made use of a type of speech recognition for keyword spotting since at least this technology allows analysts to search through large volumes of recorded conversations and isolate mentions of keywords recordings can be indexed and analysts can run queries over the database to find conversations of interest some government research programs focused on intelligence applications of speech recognition eg darpas earss program and iarpas babel program in the early 2000s speech recognition was still dominated by traditional approaches such as hidden markov models combined with feedforward artificial neural networks today however many aspects of speech recognition have been taken over by a deep learning method called long shortterm memory lstm a recurrent neural network published by sepp hochreiter jurgen schmidhuber in lstm rnns avoid the vanishing gradient problem and can learn very deep learning tasks that require memories of events that happened thousands of discrete time steps ago which is important for speech around lstm trained by connectionist temporal classification ctc started to outperform traditional speech recognition in certain applications in googles speech recognition reportedly experienced a dramatic performance jump of through ctctrained lstm which is now available through google voice to all smartphone users the use of deep feedforward nonrecurrent networks for acoustic modeling was introduced during the later part of by geoffrey hinton and his students at the university of toronto and by li deng and colleagues at microsoft research initially in the collaborative work between microsoft and the university of toronto which was subsequently expanded to include ibm and google hence the shared views of four research groups subtitle in their review paper a microsoft research executive called this innovation the most dramatic change in accuracy since in contrast to the steady incremental improvements of the past few decades the application of deep learning decreased word error rate by this innovation was quickly adopted across the field researchers have begun to use deep learning techniques for language modeling as well in the long history of speech recognition both shallow form and deep form eg recurrent nets of artificial neural networks had been explored for many years during 1980s 1990s and a few years into the 2000s but these methods never won over the nonuniform internalhandcrafting gaussian mixture modelhidden markov model gmmhmm technology based on generative models of speech trained discriminatively a number of key difficulties had been methodologically analyzed in the 1990s including gradient diminishing and weak temporal correlation structure in the neural predictive models all these difficulties were in addition to the lack of big training data and big computing power in these early days most speech recognition researchers who understood such barriers hence subsequently moved away from neural nets to pursue generative modeling approaches until the recent resurgence of deep learning starting around that had overcome all these difficulties hinton et al and deng et al reviewed part of this recent history about how their collaboration with each other and then with colleagues across four groups university of toronto microsoft google and ibm ignited a renaissance of applications of deep feedforward neural networks to speech recognition by early 2010s speech recognition also called voice recognition was clearly differentiated from speaker recognition and speaker independence was considered a major breakthrough until then systems required a training period a ad for a doll had carried the tagline finally the doll that understands you despite the fact that it was described as which children could train to respond to their voice in microsoft researchers reached a historical human parity milestone of transcribing conversational telephony speech on the widely benchmarked switchboard task multiple deep learning models were used to optimize speech recognition accuracy the speech recognition word error rate was reported to be as low as professional human transcribers working together on the same benchmark which was funded by ibm watson speech team on the same task both acoustic modeling and language modeling are important parts of modern statistically based speech recognition algorithms hidden markov models hmms are widely used in many systems language modeling is also used in many other natural language processing applications such as document classification or statistical machine translation modern generalpurpose speech recognition systems are based on hidden markov models these are statistical models that output a sequence of symbols or quantities hmms are used in speech recognition because a speech signal can be viewed as a piecewise stationary signal or a shorttime stationary signal in a short time scale eg milliseconds speech can be approximated as a stationary process speech can be thought of as a markov model for many stochastic purposes another reason why hmms are popular is that they can be trained automatically and are simple and computationally feasible to use in speech recognition the hidden markov model would output a sequence of ndimensional realvalued vectors with n being a small integer such as outputting one of these every milliseconds the vectors would consist of cepstral coefficients which are obtained by taking a fourier transform of a short time window of speech and decorrelating the spectrum using a cosine transform then taking the first most significant coefficients the hidden markov model will tend to have in each state a statistical distribution that is a mixture of diagonal covariance gaussians which will give a likelihood for each observed vector each word or for more general speech recognition systems each phoneme will have a different output distribution a hidden markov model for a sequence of words or phonemes is made by concatenating the individual trained hidden markov models for the separate words and phonemes described above are the core elements of the most common hmmbased approach to speech recognition modern speech recognition systems use various combinations of a number of standard techniques in order to improve results over the basic approach described above a typical largevocabulary system would need context dependency for the phonemes so phonemes with different left and right context have different realizations as hmm states it would use cepstral normalization to normalize for a different speaker and recording conditions for further speaker normalization it might use vocal tract length normalization vtln for malefemale normalization and maximum likelihood linear regression mllr for more general speaker adaptation the features would have socalled delta and deltadelta coefficients to capture speech dynamics and in addition might use heteroscedastic linear discriminant analysis hlda or might skip the delta and deltadelta coefficients and use splicing and an ldabased projection followed perhaps by heteroscedastic linear discriminant analysis or a global semitied co variance transform also known as maximum likelihood linear transform or mllt many systems use socalled discriminative training techniques that dispense with a purely statistical approach to hmm parameter estimation and instead optimize some classificationrelated measure of the training data examples are maximum mutual information mmi minimum classification error mce and minimum phone error mpe decoding of the speech the term for what happens when the system is presented with a new utterance and must compute the most likely source sentence would probably use the viterbi algorithm to find the best path and here there is a choice between dynamically creating a combination hidden markov model which includes both the acoustic and language model information and combining it statically beforehand the finite state transducer or fst approach a possible improvement to decoding is to keep a set of good candidates instead of just keeping the best candidate and to use a better scoring function re scoring to rate these good candidates so that we may pick the best one according to this refined score the set of candidates can be kept either as a list the nbest list approach or as a subset of the models a lattice re scoring is usually done by trying to minimize the bayes risk or an approximation thereof instead of taking the source sentence with maximal probability we try to take the sentence that minimizes the expectancy of a given loss function with regards to all possible transcriptions ie we take the sentence that minimizes the average distance to other possible sentences weighted by their estimated probability the loss function is usually the levenshtein distance though it can be different distances for specific tasks the set of possible transcriptions is of course pruned to maintain tractability efficient algorithms have been devised to re score lattices represented as weighted finite state transducers with edit distances represented themselves as a finite state transducer verifying certain assumptions dynamic time warping is an approach that was historically used for speech recognition but has now largely been displaced by the more successful hmmbased approach dynamic time warping is an algorithm for measuring similarity between two sequences that may vary in time or speed for instance similarities in walking patterns would be detected even if in one video the person was walking slowly and if in another he or she were walking more quickly or even if there were accelerations and deceleration during the course of one observation dtw has been applied to video audio and graphics indeed any data that can be turned into a linear representation can be analyzed with dtw a wellknown application has been automatic speech recognition to cope with different speaking speeds in general it is a method that allows a computer to find an optimal match between two given sequences eg time series with certain restrictions that is the sequences are warped nonlinearly to match each other this sequence alignment method is often used in the context of hidden markov models neural networks emerged as an attractive acoustic modeling approach in asr in the late 1980s since then neural networks have been used in many aspects of speech recognition such as phoneme classification phoneme classification through multiobjective evolutionary algorithms isolated word recognition audiovisual speech recognition audiovisual speaker recognition and speaker adaptation neural networks make fewer explicit assumptions about feature statistical properties than hmms and have several qualities making them attractive recognition models for speech recognition when used to estimate the probabilities of a speech feature segment neural networks allow discriminative training in a natural and efficient manner however in spite of their effectiveness in classifying shorttime units such as individual phonemes and isolated words early neural networks were rarely successful for continuous recognition tasks because of their limited ability to model temporal dependencies one approach to this limitation was to use neural networks as a preprocessing feature transformation or dimensionality reduction step prior to hmm based recognition however more recently lstm and related recurrent neural networks rnns and time delay neural networkstdnns have demonstrated improved performance in this area deep neural networks and denoising autoencoders are also under investigation a deep feedforward neural network dnn is an artificial neural network with multiple hidden layers of units between the input and output layers similar to shallow neural networks dnns can model complex nonlinear relationships dnn architectures generate compositional models where extra layers enable composition of features from lower layers giving a huge learning capacity and thus the potential of modeling complex patterns of speech data a success of dnns in large vocabulary speech recognition occurred in by industrial researchers in collaboration with academic researchers where large output layers of the dnn based on context dependent hmm states constructed by decision trees were adopted see comprehensive reviews of this development and of the state of the art as of october in the recent springer book from microsoft research see also the related background of automatic speech recognition and the impact of various machine learning paradigms notably including deep learning in recent overview articles one fundamental principle of deep learning is to do away with handcrafted feature engineering and to use raw features this principle was first explored successfully in the architecture of deep autoencoder on the raw spectrogram or linear filterbank features showing its superiority over the melcepstral features which contain a few stages of fixed transformation from spectrograms the true raw features of speech waveforms have more recently been shown to produce excellent largerscale speech recognition results since there has been much research interest in endtoend asr traditional phoneticbased ie all hmmbased model approaches required separate components and training for the pronunciation acoustic and language model endtoend models jointly learn all the components of the speech recognizer this is valuable since it simplifies the training process and deployment process for example a ngram language model is required for all hmmbased systems and a typical ngram language model often takes several gigabytes in memory making them impractical to deploy on mobile devices consequently modern commercial asr systems from google and apple as of are deployed on the cloud and require a network connection as opposed to the device locally the first attempt at endtoend asr was with connectionist temporal classification ctcbased systems introduced by alex graves of google deepmind and navdeep jaitly of the university of toronto in the model consisted of recurrent neural networks and a ctc layer jointly the rnnctc model learns the pronunciation and acoustic model together however it is incapable of learning the language due to conditional independence assumptions similar to a hmm consequently ctc models can directly learn to map speech acoustics to english characters but the models make many common spelling mistakes and must rely on a separate language model to clean up the transcripts later baidu expanded on the work with extremely large datasets and demonstrated some commercial success in chinese mandarin and english in university of oxford presented lipnet the first endtoend sentencelevel lipreading model using spatiotemporal convolutions coupled with an rnnctc architecture surpassing humanlevel performance in a restricted grammar dataset a largescale cnnrnnctc architecture was presented in by google deepmind achieving times better performance than human experts an alternative approach to ctcbased models are attentionbased models attentionbased asr models were introduced simultaneously by chan et al of carnegie mellon university and google brain and bahdanau et al of the university of montreal in the model named listen attend and spell las literally listens to the acoustic signal pays attention to different parts of the signal and spells out the transcript one character at a time unlike ctcbased models attentionbased models do not have conditionalindependence assumptions and can learn all the components of a speech recognizer including the pronunciation acoustic and language model directly this means during deployment there is no need to carry around a language model making it very practical for applications with limited memory by the end of the attentionbased models have seen considerable success including outperforming the ctc models with or without an external language model various extensions have been proposed since the original las model latent sequence decompositions lsd was proposed by carnegie mellon university mit and google brain to directly emit subword units which are more natural than english characters university of oxford and google deepmind extended las to watch listen attend and spell wlas to handle lip reading surpassing humanlevel performance typically a manual control input for example by means of a finger control on the steeringwheel enables the speech recognition system and this is signaled to the driver by an audio prompt following the audio prompt the system has a listening window during which it may accept a speech input for recognition simple voice commands may be used to initiate phone calls select radio stations or play music from a compatible smartphone mp3 player or musicloaded flash drive voice recognition capabilities vary between car make and model some of the most recentwhen car models offer naturallanguage speech recognition in place of a fixed set of commands allowing the driver to use full sentences and common phrases with such systems there is therefore no need for the user to memorize a set of fixed command words in the health care sector speech recognition can be implemented in frontend or backend of the medical documentation process frontend speech recognition is where the provider dictates into a speechrecognition engine the recognized words are displayed as they are spoken and the dictator is responsible for editing and signing off on the document backend or deferred speech recognition is where the provider dictates into a digital dictation system the voice is routed through a speechrecognition machine and the recognized draft document is routed along with the original voice file to the editor where the draft is edited and report finalized deferred speech recognition is widely used in the industry currently one of the major issues relating to the use of speech recognition in healthcare is that the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra provides for substantial financial benefits to physicians who utilize an emr according to meaningful use standards these standards require that a substantial amount of data be maintained by the emr now more commonly referred to as an electronic health record or ehr the use of speech recognition is more naturally suited to the generation of narrative text as part of a radiologypathology interpretation progress note or discharge summary the ergonomic gains of using speech recognition to enter structured discrete data eg numeric values or codes from a list or a controlled vocabulary are relatively minimal for people who are sighted and who can operate a keyboard and mouse a more significant issue is that most ehrs have not been expressly tailored to take advantage of voicerecognition capabilities a large part of the clinicians interaction with the ehr involves navigation through the user interface using menus and tabbutton clicks and is heavily dependent on keyboard and mouse voicebased navigation provides only modest ergonomic benefits by contrast many highly customized systems for radiology or pathology dictation implement voice macros where the use of certain phrases eg normal report will automatically fill in a large number of default values andor generate boilerplate which will vary with the type of the exam eg a chest xray vs a gastrointestinal contrast series for a radiology system prolonged use of speech recognition software in conjunction with word processors has shown benefits to shorttermmemory restrengthening in brain avm patients who have been treated with resection further research needs to be conducted to determine cognitive benefits for individuals whose avms have been treated using radiologic techniques substantial efforts have been devoted in the last decade to the test and evaluation of speech recognition in fighter aircraft of particular note have been the us program in speech recognition for the advanced fighter technology integration aftif16 aircraft f16 vista the program in france for mirage aircraft and other programs in the uk dealing with a variety of aircraft platforms in these programs speech recognizers have been operated successfully in fighter aircraft with applications including setting radio frequencies commanding an autopilot system setting steerpoint coordinates and weapons release parameters and controlling flight display working with swedish pilots flying in the jas39 gripen cockpit englund found recognition deteriorated with increasing gloads the report also concluded that adaptation greatly improved the results in all cases and that the introduction of models for breathing was shown to improve recognition scores significantly contrary to what might have been expected no effects of the broken english of the speakers were found it was evident that spontaneous speech caused problems for the recognizer as might have been expected a restricted vocabulary and above all a proper syntax could thus be expected to improve recognition accuracy substantially the eurofighter typhoon currently in service with the uk raf employs a speakerdependent system requiring each pilot to create a template the system is not used for any safetycritical or weaponcritical tasks such as weapon release or lowering of the undercarriage but is used for a wide range of other cockpit functions voice commands are confirmed by visual andor aural feedback the system is seen as a major design feature in the reduction of pilot workload and even allows the pilot to assign targets to his aircraft with two simple voice commands or to any of his wingmen with only five commands speakerindependent systems are also being developed and are under test for the f35 lightning ii jsf and the alenia aermacchi m346 master leadin fighter trainer these systems have produced word accuracy scores in excess of the problems of achieving high recognition accuracy under stress and noise are particularly relevant in the helicopter environment as well as in the jet fighter environment the acoustic noise problem is actually more severe in the helicopter environment not only because of the high noise levels but also because the helicopter pilot in general does not wear a facemask which would reduce acoustic noise in the microphone substantial test and evaluation programs have been carried out in the past decade in speech recognition systems applications in helicopters notably by the us army avionics research and development activity avrada and by the royal aerospace establishment rae in the uk work in france has included speech recognition in the puma helicopter there has also been much useful work in canada results have been encouraging and voice applications have included control of communication radios setting of navigation systems and control of an automated target handover system as in fighter applications the overriding issue for voice in helicopters is the impact on pilot effectiveness encouraging results are reported for the avrada tests although these represent only a feasibility demonstration in a test environment much remains to be done both in speech recognition and in overall speech technology in order to consistently achieve performance improvements in operational settings training for air traffic controllers atc represents an excellent application for speech recognition systems many atc training systems currently require a person to act as a pseudopilot engaging in a voice dialog with the trainee controller which simulates the dialog that the controller would have to conduct with pilots in a real atc situation speech recognition and synthesis techniques offer the potential to eliminate the need for a person to act as a pseudopilot thus reducing training and support personnel in theory air controller tasks are also characterized by highly structured speech as the primary output of the controller hence reducing the difficulty of the speech recognition task should be possible in practice this is rarely the case the faa document details the phrases that should be used by air traffic controllers while this document gives less than examples of such phrases the number of phrases supported by one of the simulation vendors speech recognition systems is in excess of the usaf usmc us army us navy and faa as well as a number of international atc training organizations such as the royal australian air force and civil aviation authorities in italy brazil and canada are currently using atc simulators with speech recognition from a number of different vendors asr is now commonplace in the field of telephony and is becoming more widespread in the field of computer gaming and simulation in telephony systems asr is now being predominantly used in contact centers by integrating it with ivr systems despite the high level of integration with word processing in general personal computing in the field of document production asr has not seen the expected increases in use the improvement of mobile processor speeds has made speech recognition practical in smartphones speech is used mostly as a part of a user interface for creating predefined or custom speech commands for language learning speech recognition can be useful for learning a second language it can teach proper pronunciation in addition to helping a person develop fluency with their speaking skills students who are blind see blindness and education or have very low vision can benefit from using the technology to convey words and then hear the computer recite them as well as use a computer by commanding with their voice instead of having to look at the screen and keyboard students who are physically disabled or suffer from repetitive strain injuryother injuries to the upper extremities can be relieved from having to worry about handwriting typing or working with scribe on school assignments by using speechtotext programs they can also utilize speech recognition technology to freely enjoy searching the internet or using a computer at home without having to physically operate a mouse and keyboard speech recognition can allow students with learning disabilities to become better writers by saying the words aloud they can increase the fluidity of their writing and be alleviated of concerns regarding spelling punctuation and other mechanics of writing also see learning disability the use of voice recognition software in conjunction with a digital audio recorder and a personal computer running wordprocessing software has proven to be positive for restoring damaged shortterm memory capacity in stroke and craniotomy individuals people with disabilities can benefit from speech recognition programs for individuals that are deaf or hard of hearing speech recognition software is used to automatically generate a closedcaptioning of conversations such as discussions in conference rooms classroom lectures andor religious services speech recognition is also very useful for people who have difficulty using their hands ranging from mild repetitive stress injuries to involve disabilities that preclude using conventional computer input devices in fact people who used the keyboard a lot and developed rsi became an urgent early market for speech recognition speech recognition is used in deaf telephony such as voicemail to text relay services and captioned telephone individuals with learning disabilities who have problems with thoughttopaper communication essentially they think of an idea but it is processed incorrectly causing it to end up differently on paper can possibly benefit from the software but the technology is not bug proof also the whole idea of speak to text can be hard for intellectually disabled persons due to the fact that it is rare that anyone tries to learn the technology to teach the person with the disability this type of technology can help those with dyslexia but other disabilities are still in question the effectiveness of the product is the problem that is hindering it from being effective although a kid may be able to say a word depending on how clear they say it the technology may think they are saying another word and input the wrong one giving them more work to fix causing them to have to take more time with fixing the wrong word the performance of speech recognition systems is usually evaluated in terms of accuracy and speed accuracy is usually rated with word error rate wer whereas speed is measured with the real time factor other measures of accuracy include single word error rate swer and command success rate csr speech recognition by machine is a very complex problem however vocalizations vary in terms of accent pronunciation articulation roughness nasality pitch volume and speed speech is distorted by a background noise and echoes electrical characteristics accuracy of speech recognition may vary with the following as mentioned earlier in this article the accuracy of speech recognition may vary depending on the following factors with discontinuous speech full sentences separated by silence are used therefore it becomes easier to recognize the speech as well as with isolated speech with continuous speech naturally spoken sentences are used therefore it becomes harder to recognize the speech different from both isolated and discontinuous speech constraints are often represented by grammar speech recognition is a multileveled pattern recognition task eg known word pronunciations or legal word sequences which can compensate for errors or uncertainties at a lower level for telephone speech the sampling rate is samples per second computed every ms with one ms section called a frame analysis of fourstep neural network approaches can be explained by further information sound is produced by air or some other medium vibration which we register by ears but machines by receivers basic sound creates a wave which has two descriptions amplitude how strong is it and frequency how often it vibrates per second accuracy can be computed with the help of word error rate wer word error rate can be calculated by aligning the recognized word and referenced word using dynamic string alignment the problem may occur while computing the word error rate due to the difference between the sequence lengths of the recognized word and referenced word let the formula to compute the word error ratewer is while computing the word recognition rate wrr word error rate wer is used and the formula is here h is the number of correctly recognized words h nsd speech recognition can become a means of attack theft or accidental operation for example activation words like alexa spoken in an audio or video broadcast can cause devices in homes and offices to start listening for input inappropriately or possibly take an unwanted action voicecontrolled devices are also accessible to visitors to the building or even those outside the building if they can be heard inside attackers may be able to gain access to personal information like calendar address book contents private messages and documents they may also be able to impersonate the user to send messages or make online purchases two attacks have been demonstrated that use artificial sounds one transmits ultrasound and attempt to send commands without nearby people noticing the other adds small inaudible distortions to other speech or music that are specially crafted to confuse the specific speech recognition system into recognizing music as speech or to make what sounds like one command to a human sound like a different command to the system popular speech recognition conferences held each year or two include speechtek and speechtek europe icassp interspeecheurospeech and the ieee asru conferences in the field of natural language processing such as acl naacl emnlp and hlt are beginning to include papers on speech processing important journals include the ieee transactions on speech and audio processing later renamed ieee transactions on audio speech and language processing and since sept renamed ieeeacm transactions on audio speech and language processingafter merging with an acm publication computer speech and language and speech communication books like fundamentals of speech recognition by lawrence rabiner can be useful to acquire basic knowledge but may not be fully up to date another good source can be statistical methods for speech recognition by frederick jelinek and spoken language processing by xuedong huang etc computer speech by manfred r schroeder second edition published in and speech processing a dynamic and optimizationoriented approach published in by li deng and doug oshaughnessey the updated textbook speech and language processing by jurafsky and martin presents the basics and the state of the art for asr speaker recognition also uses the same features most of the same frontend processing and classification techniques as is done in speech recognition a comprehensive textbook fundamentals of speaker recognition is an in depth source for up to date details on the theory and practice a good insight into the techniques used in the best modern systems can be gained by paying attention to government sponsored evaluations such as those organised by darpa the largest speech recognitionrelated project ongoing as of is the gale project which involves both speech recognition and translation components a good and accessible introduction to speech recognition technology and its history is provided by the general audience book the voice in the machine building computers that understand speech by roberto pieraccini the most recent book on speech recognition is automatic speech recognition a deep learning approach publisher springer written by microsoft researchers d yu and l deng and published near the end of with highly mathematically oriented technical detail on how deep learning methods are derived and implemented in modern speech recognition systems based on dnns and related deep learning methods a related book published earlier in deep learning methods and applications by l deng and d yu provides a less technical but more methodologyfocused overview of dnnbased speech recognition during placed within the more general context of deep learning applications including not only speech recognition but also image recognition natural language processing information retrieval multimodal processing and multitask learning in terms of freely available resources carnegie mellon universitys sphinx toolkit is one place to start to both learn about speech recognition and to start experimenting another resource free but copyrighted is the htk book and the accompanying htk toolkit for more recent and stateoftheart techniques kaldi toolkit can be used in mozilla launched the open source project called common voice to gather big database of voices that would help build free speech recognition project deepspeech available free at github using googles open source platform tensorflow when mozilla redirected funding away from the project in it was forked by its original developers as coqui stt using the same opensource license the commercial cloud based speech recognition apis are broadly available for more software resources see list of speech recognition software"}
